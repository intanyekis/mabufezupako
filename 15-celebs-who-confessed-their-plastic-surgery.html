I’m pretty sure that most producers have it in a celebrity’s contract that they must keep their youthful glow forever. After all, isn’t that why celebrities go out and get work done, even before they require it? It’s bred out of fear. They are so scared to lose their looks that they are willing to do anything to stay young. But getting plastic surgery can be terrifying- especially since there are no guarantees that it will be any better. Or worse, that it won’t end up changing their appearance so completely that they are unrecognizable. Poor <a href=#>Jennifer Grey</a>, she took her Dirty Dancing paycheck and wanted to fix the bump on her nose. She came out unrecognizable; she was beautiful, but she had a hard time getting cast in any movies after because no one knew who she was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the most part, celebrities don’t like to talk about the surgeries that they have. They like to keep that on the down-low and hope that we don’t notice. It takes a pretty skilled plastic surgeon, however, to be able to pull that off; though it has been done. Other celebrities are fairly open about what they’ve had done and will discuss it in interviews. There seems to be a love/hate relationship when it comes to plastic surgery. Check out the celebrity confessions below of celebrities who have done the deed and lived to tell about it.</p><h2 id=15-la-toya-jackson><strong>15. La Toya Jackson</strong></h2><p>Plastic surgery and the name Jackson is synonymous. After all, hasn’t the whole family gone under the knife at some point? <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> seemed to have an obsession with it. In <a href=#>La Toya’s</a> case, it seems like she has the same obsession. Her look has drastically changed to the point where she isn't even recognizable from the way she looked in her 20s. She has often stated that she has no problem with the plastic surgery and has laughed off claims that her family has gone too far when it comes to changing their appearance. In the end, the Jackson family is a strong unit, and they’ve always provided a united front. They genuinely don’t care what other people think of them. They live by their own values, and they won’t justify why they go under the knife. To each their own I guess, but I think she looked pretty good before all the surgery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-iggy-azalea><strong>14. Iggy Azalea</strong></h2><p>Iggy&nbsp;didn’t keep it a secret when she went out and got breast implants as well as a nose job. She’s openly talked about it and feels that anyone that undergoes plastic surgery should not feel ashamed about it. She believes that everybody is getting plastic surgery these days and doesn’t believe that it should be considered to be frowned upon. When she was questioned about it, she responded with sarcasm saying that the only reason why haters speak about it is that they are jealous that they can’t do the same thing. Maybe she’s right: “Everyone tells you that you should love your body the way it is, but then it is bad to say that you want to change something about yourself not because you want to look like someone else, just because you want to? What’s wrong with that? There’s nothing black and white about beauty or plastic surgery. There are no guarantees that it will fix how you feel about yourself.” OK, Iggy, OK.</p><h2 id=13-khloe-kardashian><strong>13. Khloe Kardashian</strong></h2><p>The Kardashian family is another clan that has no problem heaping on as much plastic surgery as possible. Every single one of them looks nothing like they did before the surgery happened. Even the younger generation has hopped on the train before they were barely adults. <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> was getting plastic surgery long before she should have. She was barely into womanhood before she was drastically changing her appearance. It’s a tragedy really because the girls were all beautiful before they went under the knife and to have plastic surgery at such a young age seems crazy. <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> has been pretty vocal about plastic surgery, mainly because they couldn’t hide the fact even if she wanted to. She spoke to Cosmopolitan about the issue and said, “I think plastic surgery should be viewed almost like makeup because we’re all putting on a f**king mask basically every day anyway.” Wow Khloe, tell us what you really think!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-kelly-rowland><strong>12. Kelly Rowland</strong></h2><p>Kelly has always been a stunning creature; it’s kind of sad that she would go under the knife. When it comes to girls with small breasts, it’s kind of always in the back of their minds that implants wouldn’t hurt. She was one celebrity that didn’t get them right away, in fact; it took her awhile before she made the decision to do so. She always wanted them since she was a teenager but went with the advice of her mother that she should wait, and wait she did. She was 28 before she decided to do it because she wanted to make sure that she was physically and mentally prepared for it. She went so far as to wear a padded bra for a while so that she was used to the feeling of new breasts before she actually got them. She’s always taken good care of herself, saying “I never like to say diet. I like to say eating clean. Listening to your body and knowing what your body responds well to. For me, it’s green vegetables or fish. I don’t feel like I’m heavy or weighed down or lethargic when I eat. Food should give you energy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-nicole-kidman><strong>11. Nicole Kidman</strong></h2><p>Nicole Kidman is another stunning woman who should never have bothered to try to change her face. Although it looks like she has had some surgery done, she will only admit to Botox. She was doing it for awhile but found that she had that “frozen” look that freaks everyone out. What boggles my mind is that with all the money these celebrities have you would think that they could get amazing procedures done that wouldn’t give them the appearance of being statues. Though shockingly enough there are many celebrities who are paying tons of money and either coming out looking like a stranger or have completely botched work. Nicole has stated that she regrets the Botox she did and will never do it again. “I did try Botox, unfortunately, but I got out of it, and now I can finally move my face again,” she said in an interview with La Repubblica.</p><h2 id=10-ariel-winter><strong>10. Ariel Winter</strong></h2><p>Sometimes plastic surgery is done, not to make someone look younger or to give someone a new rack. There are times when plastic surgery is done to make someone feel physically better about themselves. Many people, in general, will get a breast reduction done because they have been “too blessed” in the breast area. They begin to develop back pain and having big breasts stops becoming fun and becomes more of a nuisance. The choice to have a breast reduction is more out of necessity than anything else, and it becomes a great relief to people who go through with it. It’s no different for celebrities, and <a href=#>Ariel Winter</a> is one celebrity that has no regrets. In an interview with Glamour magazine, she stated, "I got it for myself. I can't even really put it into words about how amazing it feels to really feel right."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-kathy-griffin><strong>9. Kathy Griffin</strong></h2><p>It’s no big surprise that <a href=#>Kathy Griffin</a> has had plastic surgery- her face tells quite the story these days. It’s unfortunate because I don’t think that it improved her look at all. She never hides the fact that she has had surgery either, though, she’s pretty vocal about the whole thing. She has even used it in her comedy routines. She was pretty young when she started with plastic surgery, getting a nose job at the age of 26. She decided to do it based on comments that she received from the people in her life. “I was told repeatedly, ‘You would be pretty if it weren’t for that nose. You’d work more if it weren’t for that nose. Hey, have you considered getting a nose job?’ You would think I had a nose the size of Texas. I was young and impressionable, and I was told that enough that I started to believe it, so I got a nose job.” I guess the rest followed from there.</p><h2 id=8-jamie-lee-curtis><strong>8. Jamie Lee Curtis</strong></h2><p>Jamie Lee Curtis was considered to be the "Scream Queen" for many years due to her roles in classic horror films. It wasn’t just due to her striking vocals, however, it was because she was smoking hot and people just couldn’t get enough of her. Over the years she has changed a lot, however, and eventually she went for plastic surgery. She is one celebrity that has spoken out about her regrets about the surgery that she has undergone. She even got hooked on painkillers after one procedure. “I’ve done it all. I’ve had a little plastic surgery. I’ve had a little lipo. I’ve had a little Botox. And you know what? None of it works. None of it.” She also admitted to getting an under-eye procedure done to get fat removed because she noticed that her eyes look puffy while she was on set making a movie. It was one procedure that she’s always regretted getting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-ashley-tisdale><strong>7. Ashley Tisdale</strong></h2><p>We know<a href=#> Ashley</a> from the High School Musical movies, and we can’t help but feel bad that she’s already had plastic surgery done. She’s cute as a button! She states however that she got the nose job because of her health as she literally couldn’t breathe. She insists that she had a deviated septum which could be true, but it’s also the excuse everyone gives when they’ve had a nose job. There’s no doubt about it, any nose job will help you to breathe better, but it also changed her appearance for the better, so you have to wonder if it really was for aesthetic reasons. A lot of critics gave her a hard time about the nose job stating that it was not necessary at all. All in all, Ashley had some bumps removed that were the result of being hit in the face multiple times. Maybe the better question is: What?!!? Despite the critic’s opinions, Ashley has stuck&nbsp;with her decision to have the nose job and denies rumors that she actually has had two nose jobs.</p><h2 id=6-heidi-montag><strong>6. Heidi Montag</strong></h2><p>Heidi is one reality star that seemed to get in way over her head when it comes to getting plastic surgery. Once she started, it seemed like she couldn’t stop. By the time she was done she barely resembled the fresh-faced girls that showed up on The Hills. She started the surgeries while she was still on the show, so the viewers got to see it all go down. During a People magazine interview in 2010, Heidi went into detail about her plastic surgeries. She talked about how she went under a whopping ten surgeries all in one day. That must have been a terror on her body. The doctor that performed her surgeries insisted that she get an eyebrow lift and a chin reduction and there’s a good chance that he was taking advantage of the young star. “I felt really insecure and felt that I was being given a really great deal. He didn’t tell me how extensive it was going to be, how severe, how painful, so I had no idea.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-pamela-anderson><strong>5. Pamela Anderson</strong></h2><p>You may not be aware of it, but<a href=#> Pamela Anderson</a> got her big break all because she went to the right football game. She was spotted on the Jumbotron and Playboy couldn’t get a hold of her fast enough to be featured on the cover. There’s no doubt about it that Pamela got multiple boob jobs throughout her life and she’s never had an issue speaking about it. Her reason for doing it was that “Everyone was doing it.” She talks pretty openly about her breasts: “I’d say they’ve had a pretty good career. I’ve basically been tagging along for the ride.” After she got her cover with Playboy, she ended up getting further work in the industry as well as appearing as one of the leads in Baywatch and a few other TV shows and film. She even had her own show at one point, but it didn’t last very long.</p><h2 id=4-tara-reid><strong>4. Tara Reid</strong></h2><p>It’s no big surprise that <a href=#>Tara Reid</a> had quite the fiasco when it came to getting plastic surgery. In fact, her breast implants went so badly that she could be the poster child for why someone should never go under the knife. When Tara Reid got her big break in The American Pie franchise, she decided to get a boob job as well as liposuction even though she’s always been a thin girl. She’s hardly someone that would need liposuction. She regretted the liposuction because it left her with rippled skin and a slight deformity. She lost a lot of job opportunities because she was never able to wear a bikini. She’s scared to even to try fixing it, saying: “I’m scared about getting surgery ever again. It’s like surviving a plane crash and getting on a plane again. [My stomach scars] are my battle wounds; boom, that’s it. Would I be naked in front of a random person? No. Would I do the cover of Playboy? No.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-dolly-parton><strong>3. Dolly Parton</strong></h2><p>Dolly is another woman that was quite beautiful in her prime and got plastic surgery way before she needed it. At this point, she doesn’t look much like her old self. In fact, she was so beautiful before the surgery it’s unfortunate that she did it in the first place. She’s had just about every surgery possible, from Botox to breast implants. She’s the kind of girl that doesn’t like to talk about it; she was pretty much hoping no one would notice: “Well, I never would have said I did it if I hadn’t got caught at it. But I wasn’t gonna lie about it! I’m not being the poster child for any of that, but people know you do it. If they ask me, I just say, ‘Yeah, whatever. And I ain’t done yet!'” She clearly has no issue with her surgeries- she even recommends plastic surgery to anyone that would consider it.</p><h2 id=2-lisa-kudrow><strong>2. Lisa Kudrow</strong></h2><p>This is one of the best plastic surgery jobs that I’ve seen in awhile because I didn’t see it coming. Her nose looks great, and it doesn’t really look like it’s been altered. <a href=#>Lisa </a>got her nose job done long before she even became famous on Friends. She’s never been happier about her nose job and has never regretted it: “I went from, in my mind, hideous, to not hideous. I did it the summer before going to a new high school. So there were plenty of people who wouldn’t know how hideous I looked before. That was a good, good, good change. That was life altering.” She was actually once in an improv class with <a href=#>Conan O’Brien</a>, and he inspired her to stay in the class based on his own performance. It was something that helped further her career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-joan-rivers><strong>1. Joan Rivers</strong></h2><p>She may be the Queen of plastic surgery because she has had an obscene amount of surgeries. She’s spoken openly about the surgeries that she had over the years and even wrote a book called, Men Are Stupid…And They Like Big Boobs: A Woman’s Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery. “Looking good equals feeling good … I’d rather look younger and feel happy than look older and be depressed.” You might be shocked to find out that <a href=#>Joan</a>&nbsp;had over 700 treatments and she considered it a good “jolt.” She often wished that she had a twin so she would know what she really looked like when she got older. So would we! She drastically altered her appearance to the point that she looked nothing like her younger self. Joan’s death was caused because she stopped breathing after she underwent a routine endoscopy. She experienced a lack of oxygen after the surgery and ended up becoming brain damaged as a result.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5lk5q5pq7SZq6hp12YvK%2ByxKyqnpxdqbWmtdFmp6WZo6m2pHnSrqmgnaKufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aditya-chopra-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aditya Chopra Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
