CNN correspondent Rene Marsh knows that too well as she announced that her son, Blake, passed away from pediatric brain cancer.</p><p class=dh>Marsh documented Blake's battle against pediatric cancer, considered one of the most deadly diseases among children.

The diagnosis left the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://edition.cnn.com/profiles/rene-marsh-profile#about>Binghamton University alum</a> feeling paralyzed and emotional.</p><p class=dh>The unexpected turn in Blake's life broke Marsh. Her son underwent several procedures when he was 10 months old, including brain surgery and chemotherapy. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B8eq8AInMgL/>shared</a> in her February 2020 post:</p><p class=dh>"I will not forget the moment the doctors came to the waiting room to tell us that our son's heart stopped beating. We were broken."</p><p class=dh>But Marsh recalled heaving a sigh of relief when the doctors informed her that Blake's heart was beating again, albeit not as stronger as before.</p><p class=dh>After the surgery, Blake was placed on life support at the ICU for several days. Although Blake's health improved and he was discharged from the ICU, he still went through rounds of chemotherapy.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Marsh is not the only CNN journalist to lose a child to cancer.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Unfortunately, Blake's cancer <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CIj7DCLFJse/>returned</a> a week before Thanksgiving in December 2020. The news shattered Marsh.

Marsh <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNtHhJbL3HB/?utm_source=ig_embed">emotionally wrote</a> that all of her dreams and hopes for him were gone. She was supposed to celebrate her birthday with Blake, but she found herself <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/p/CNxU618LKuQ/>picking a gravesite</a> for him instead.</p><p class=dh>Prior to Blake's passing, Marsh has been helping raise more awareness about pediatric cancer.

In her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/rene-marsh-marks-her-first-birthday-after-sons-death/>son's honor,</a> she urged her followers to donate to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.</p><p class=dh>The veteran TV journalist's life <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/cnn-reporter-rene-marsh-reveals-death-son-2-brain-cancer-t215286>had changed</a> after she welcomed Blake. She felt blessed and honored to become his mom. She also wanted to dedicate her life to fighting pediatric cancer.</p><p class=dh>Marsh is not the only CNN journalist to lose a child to cancer.
