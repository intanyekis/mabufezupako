Robert Morse was best known for <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">roles on Broadway</a>, but he starred on the big screen too.</p><p>With a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">career spanning decades</a>, Morse was friends with Walter Matthau, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Angela Lansbury</a> and Nathan Lane. The two-time Tony winner had a net worth of $5 million at the time of his death on April 20, but at 90-years-old, family and friends can certainly attest to his talent, joy and ability to catch the audience’s eye.</p><p>Let’s take a look back at Morse’s quiet but successful career.</p><h2 id=getting-an-early-start>Getting an Early Start</h2><p>Robert Allen Morse was born in Newton, MA and developed a love for performing in high school. After attending several schools, Morse met Henry Lasker, a music teacher at Newton High School and the educator <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">inspired him</a> to follow his dreams. Leaving home for New York City, Morse joined his older brother, already studying at the Neighborhood Playhouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=early-days-on-the-stage>Early Days On The Stage</h2><p>In 1949, Morse made his <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Broadway debut</a> with On the Town, training with famed acting teacher Lee Strasberg. He starred as Barnaby Tucker in The Matchmaker, and others such as Say, Darling and Take Me Along (starring Jackie Gleason) according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> but as some actors easily make the transition from the stage to the big screen, it seemed as though audiences preferred the gap-toothed, loveable character in-person.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">10 Hollywood Stars You Didn't Know Were On Broadway</a></span></p><h2 id=getting-recognized-for-his-talent>Getting Recognized For His Talent</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morse’s breakthrough role was in 1961 as J. Pierpont Finch in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, for which he won his first Tony. How to Succeed… follows a window washer (Morse) who makes it big simply by reading a manual and following directions. (The 1995 Broadway revival also earned <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Matthew Broderick </a>a Tony for his role as Finch) Morse caught the eye and hearts of audiences with his signature song, “I Believe in You” as he sang to himself in the mirror. The show won the Pulitzer Prize and Tony for Best Musical and ran on stage for more than three years according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>. That performance also led to some larger roles for Morse in the 1960’s.</p><h2 id=making-it-to-hollywood>Making It To Hollywood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Morse took The Matchmaker to the big screen in 1958 and How to Succeed… in 1967 alongside Michele Lee and Rudy Vallee, he also made several <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">comedy films</a> in the 1960’s. He starred in The Loved One, the story of an Englishman’s encounter with Hollywood and the funeral industry and alongside Walter Matthau in A Guide for the Married Man. In 1968, Morse co-starred with Doris Day in Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">MSN</a>, the most recent generation will remember Morse as the autocratic and eccentric leader of an advertising agency, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Bertram Cooper, in </a>Man Men, the hit AMC drama that earned him four Emmy nominations and one win for best guest actor in a drama series.</p><p>He also appeared in the 2016 crime drama, American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson as journalist Dominik Dunne and alongside <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">John Travolta</a> and Sarah Paulson.</p><h2 id=returning-to-broadway>Returning to Broadway</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a string of comedy films, Morse returned to the live stage in Sugar, producer David Merrick’s <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">musical version</a> of Some Like it Hot and Tru, a one-man performance based on the life of Truman Capote. Again, Morse stole the hearts of audiences and won his second Tony award for his role in Tru in 1989. The 1993 televised version of the Capote biopic won Morse an Emmy for best actor in a miniseries or special.</p><p>At 85-years-old, Morse appeared in the 2016 revival The Front Page alongside Nathan Lane.</p><h2 id=lending-his-voice-for-several-roles>Lending His Voice For Several Roles</h2><p>Morse’ iconic <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">voice served several animated films</a> and television series, including Teen Titans Go! as the voice of Santa Claus in the 2013 series, The Legend of Korra, Pound Puppies and ProStars according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. Morse provided the voice for several Rankin/Bass specials, including the voice of Jack in Jack Frost and The First Easter Rabbit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Morse joined Matthau again in the television classic The Stingiest Man in Town, taking the role of young scrooge in the animated version of Charles Dicken’s Christmas Carol.</p><h2 id=creating-a-legacy>Creating A Legacy</h2><p>Morse was married twice and had five children, including daughters that followed in his footsteps. Oldest daughter Andrea Doven took small roles in films like Cocktail, until shelving her acting career to work as <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise</a>’ assistant. She quickly moved to the top of his company and ran the day-to-day operations for more 20 years.</p><p>Youngest daughter Robin has had small roles in films like 1996’s The First Wives Club starring Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Diane Keaton</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">15 MORE Celebrity Pairings You Wouldn't Believe Are From The Same Family</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">MSN</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmmpGYuG6t02apqJqVp8Fuuc6rqp6rXZius7HEq2Sipl2dvK242LCmqJxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christine-arians-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-61177-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Christine Arians Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bridgerton-star-says-this-is-what-the-queens-wardrobe-reveals-about-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Bridgerton' Star Says This Is What The Queen's Wardrobe Reveals About Her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
