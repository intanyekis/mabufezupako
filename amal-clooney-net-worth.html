She is a British-Lebanese lawyer, best known for handling cases on human rights and international law. Her clients include former prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko, and <a href=#>Julian Assange</a> the founder of WikiLeaks. Amal is also known for being the wife of famous actor <a href=#>George Clooney</a>.</p><p>How rich is Amal Clooney? Sources estimate that her net worth is at $10 million, mostly accumulated from a very successful law career. She’s handled numerous high profile cases including working on various tasks that have her involved with international issues. Along with her husband, they own a Mill House on an island in the River Thames in England, which is rumoured to have cost 10 million pounds.</p><h3>Amal Clooney Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p><a href=#>Amal</a> was born during the time of the Lebanon Civil War, which prompted their family to move to England. There she attended Dr Challoner’s High School at Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, and then studied at St. Hugh’s College where she received an Exhibition and the Shrigley Award, and in the year 2000, Amal graduated with a degree in Jurisprudence.</p><p>Clooney started her law career in New York City, working as part of the Criminal and Investigations Group for Sullivan & Cromwell. After three years working there, she went to the International Court of Justice, as one of the NYU-sponsored clerks. Her net worth was slowly rising at this point, and increased as she then worked in the Office of the Prosecutor at the UN Special Tribunal for Lebanon, and later the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. By 2010, she had returned to Britain and become a barrister in London at Doughty Street Chambers. Three years later she became part of various United Nations commissions, like the 2013 Drone Inquiry on the use of drones for counter-terrorism operations. She also became an adviser for <a href=#>Kofi Annan</a>, UN Syrian Special Envoy.</p><p>Her numerous endeavors eventually earned her the opportunity to teach at schools like the Columbia Law School’s Human Rights Institute, SOAS at the University of London, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, The Hague Academy of International Law, and The New School in New York City. All added to her net worth.</p><p><a href=#>Amal</a> has handled various cases during the course of her career. These include the Cambodian-Thai border dispute, the Mohamed Fahmy case in Egypt, the Israel-Gaza conflict, the Elgin Marbles, Armenian Genocide, and many more. One of her recent cases is her representation of Azerbaijani journalist Chagos Islanders regarding Human Rights on her recent investigation and eventual imprisonment.</p><p>Aside from her work, she is involved in philanthropy, like establishing the <a href=#>Amal Clooney</a> Scholarship, which aims to send one female student from Lebanon to the United World College Dilijan every year.</p><p>For Amal’s personal life not much is known, except for her highly publicized marriage to actor <a href=#>George Clooney</a> in September 2014, attended by a lot of big names as they were married by former mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.263754045307><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Amal Clooney</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 3, 1978</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Beirut, Lebanon</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>A British-Lebanese lawyer, activist, and author</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Education</td><td>Dr Challoner’s High School at Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, St Hugh's College, Oxford, New York University School of Law</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British and Lebanese</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>George Clooney (m. 2014)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Parents</td><td>Baria Alamuddin, Ramzi Alamuddin,</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Siblings</td><td>Tala Alamuddin, Ziad Alamuddin, Samer Alamuddin,</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007802/</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>An Exhibition and the Shrigley Award at St. Hugh’s College, Jack J.
