At the start of Season 6 of Below Deck: Mediterranean, chief stew Katie Flood revealed that she’d had a 1 and a half year romance with former Below Deck Med deckhand Jack Stirrup. He had even gotten her face tattooed on his arm just a few days into their love affair.</p><h2>Jack and Katie</h2><p>Katie says she met Jack in Thailand, and she knew their relationship was ill-fated from the start. It was a passionate romance, but not one built to last. She says he was a good boyfriend up until the end, which seems like the filmed boatmance Jack had with Aesha on the show.</p><p>“I love Jack. Like, he actually got my face tattooed on his arm,” Katie said at the start of this season. “It had been like 10 days of us knowing each other. I was just like, ‘What the actual f–k?'”</p><p>Here’s a close-up of the tattoo, which Jack showed on Below Deck Med:</p><img decoding=async title="Screen Shot 2021-07-26 at 2.10.26 PM" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-26-at-2.10.26-PM.png alt width=359 height=331 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“We were just so young, too passionate, never gonna work. But, like, at least we were together for about a year-and-a-half, you know? It kind of makes it worth it, right?”</p><p>She says she couldn’t bring herself to watch Jack’s season of the show for a while, but when she eventually did she found him to be exactly the same as when she knew him.</p><h2>Jack and Aesha</h2><p>On season 4 of Below Deck Med Jack shared a cute romance with 2nd Stew Aesha Scott. They were joined at the hip every minute they weren’t working and even got to move into the same bunk because of a crew shakeup. Even though they slept in the same cramped space for a while, Aesha refused to sleep with Jack until they were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, which occurred right before the very last charter.</p><p>Although he officially asked Aesha to be his girlfriend using a bedsheet, the adorable boatmance fell apart the minute they stepped off the yacht. Jack promised Aesha he would take her with him as his plus one to a wedding, but he ghosted her and she saw him with his ex-girlfriend at the wedding on Instagram stories.</p><h2>Jack is now a dad</h2><p>In April 2020, Jack and his girlfriend Kelly Hidge his first child, Phoenix Sidney Stirrup.</p><p>Katie wasn’t surprised to hear that Jack’s a dad now. “He’s wanted to be a dad for so long. It’s super funny, ’cause he comes across as such a, like, playboy and a real lad and likes a good time,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Daily Dish</a>. “But he’s actually a really big family person. And he has such a beautiful soul. And he’s always wanted a family,” she shared. “So I’m so happy for him. And he loves his kid so much. So, yeah, it’s really cool to see that.”</p><p>Maybe an upcoming season of Below Deck Med will reunite these two!</p><p><br><br><br></p><a title="Web Analytics" href=# rel=noopener><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.statcounter.com/8656821/0/6134e3f5/1/ alt="Web Analytics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p><br></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkr6a4zrBknZ2ToHquscNmopqsmZp6p7jOqJtmnJGpsqV5yZqapGWjqbazvtSpZJqmlGK1pnnHmqpmoJWnerWt062mqJ2UYryveceiqmaZoqJ8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dana-katz-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dana Katz Net Worth How Much is Dana Katz Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./azealia-banks-hates-fat-white-americans-slams-lorde-kanye-2015163.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Azealia Banks Hates &amp;quot;Fat White Americans,&amp;quot; Slams Lorde, Kanye</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
