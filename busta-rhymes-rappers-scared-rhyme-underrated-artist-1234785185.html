He chose Marciano based on his opinion that a lot of his peers are afraid of collaborating with him out of fear of being lyrically outclassed by the Hempstead, Long Island, native. “Roc Marciano,” Busta simply said of his selection. “A lot of people are scared to rhyme with him.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 51-year-old has spoken glowingly about Roc Marciano on numerous occasions, continuously listing him among the most elite spitters he’s ever worked with. In 2018, he even included the tenured wordsmith in his personal top five list of rappers in the history of Hip-Hop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-899739932.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When I say Roc Marci is my top five MC ever, there’s a whole lot of science behind that,” Busta said during an appearance at one of the rapper’s live shows. “The God Roc Marciano is a godsend… The precision, his ability to be an incredible architect with words. The man is a craftsman with the pen.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, adding, “Roc Marci exemplifies a timeless greatness, and there’s a lot of great ni**as that’s afraid to rhyme with him,” he said. And then, he repeated his statement once more for good measure: “There’s a lot of great n**gas that’s afraid to rhyme with him.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Enlisted as a member of the Flipmode Squad during the late ’90s, Roc Marciano first made waves with his appearance on Busta’s 2000 album Anarchy on “The Heist” featuring Ghostface Killah and Raekwon. Forming the rap group The U.N. shortly after, Roc Marciano’s output was sporadic during the ’00s, but he saw a resurgence with his critically-acclaimed solo debut Marcberg in 2010. Since then, he has <a href=#>released several solo albums</a> and collaborative projects, including his most recent drop The Elephant Man’s Bones with The Alchemist in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1186802583.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5fCtMDAZqmhsZ2awG6%2BwKmnnqqjYsCkrdGem2aqmK66pnnUp5ueqqKWwaawjJqpraGjqXpyfpJtbnFtYW2CcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eva-mendes-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eva Mendes Net Worth How Much is Eva Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anna-bongiorni.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anna Bongiorni</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
