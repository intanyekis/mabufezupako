He has also been writing songs about his experiences on <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Idol.&nbsp;</p><p>It was undoubtedly hard on the teen singer to have left American Idol the way he did, that too just two performances away from the finals.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Still, his parents have been at his corner, supporting him through the entire ordeal.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>His Supportive Parents</h2><p>In a Facebook post from May 14, 2021, his father, Mark Kennedy, who had a front-row seat while Caleb performed on Idol,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">updated</a> his profile picture to a photo of the young songster with a frame that read, "I stand with Caleb Kennedy. Caleb Strong."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Following suit, his mom, Anita Guy,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded</a> a profile picture with the same frame. Even his stepfather <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">put up</a> a snap of himself on&nbsp;Facebook to reflect the same text.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Almost immediately after the news of Caleb's elimination had been made public, Anita got in touch with the Herald-Journal to clarify the three-second clip that had thrown her son to the wolves.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>It Was Not What It Looked Like</h2><p>The video in question was a Snapchat clip of the Idol alum leaning against a wooden panel while someone who appeared to be wearing the Ku Klux Klan hood sat down beside him and posed for the camera.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to the mother, the happenings of that day were&nbsp;not at all what they looked like.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, the hooded figure was not a white supremacist. Instead, it was a costume inspired by the movie The Strangers: Prey at Night. The movie had amassed a fandom at the time, and Caleb just happened to be one such fan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The doting mother did acknowledge what it looked like and assured the publication that her son did not "have a racist bone in his body." She further explained that Caleb had friends of all races and loved all of them indiscriminately.&nbsp;</p><h2>Caleb's Apology</h2><p>Caleb, however, decided to be the bigger man and took responsibility for his acts, regardless of the act being a mistake of his 12-year-old self.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His Instagram apology reaffirmed that the contents of the video were not what it seemed like, but considering that he has let down his fans, he thought an apology was owed nevertheless.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His apology ended on a positive note though. He still had hopes of earning the trust and respect that he had lost because of the controversy, and he was thankful to people who stood in support.&nbsp;</p><p>In a more recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a>, Caleb revealed that he did not regret going on American Idol. On the contrary, he actually loved the experience.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurbHBZqKepp6asbp5z5qpnqakqHquu8xmm5qcXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-link-a-paypal-prepaid-card-to-your-paypal-account.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Link a PayPal Prepaid Card to Your PayPal Account</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-charbonnet-parents-everything-about-the-american-football-running-back.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Charbonnet Parents: Everything About The American Football Running Back</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
