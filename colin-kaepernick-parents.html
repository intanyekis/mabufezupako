If they were alive today they would have been 34 and 32 years old respectively.</p><p>Rick had a job opportunity as an operations manager at the Hilmar Cheese Company. Despite Colin having a darker skin color than the rest of the family.</p><p>Rick always stood for Trayce in his support and defended him when anyone said anything.</p><p>Teresa Kaepernick, Colin’s adoptive mother works as a nurse.
