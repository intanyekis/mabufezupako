Though David and Victoria were present for the royal couple’s 2018 nuptials, they didn’t extend an invite to their son’s 2022 wedding to American heiress Nicola Peltz.</p><p>Speculation that Harry and Meghan believed David and Victoria were spreading stories about to them to the press began circulating last month.</p><p>“Every night [Harry and Meghan] scoured the internet to read the newspaper reports and the trolls’ postings on social media,” royal expert Tom Bower claimed in his book Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Kate Middleton Jealous Of Meghan Markle’s Career?</a></span></p><p>“Irrationally, they grouped the two together and fed each other’s frenzy about the media,” he went on. “Convinced that as champions of goodness they were being persecuted by mendacity and racism, they felt victimized by the mildest criticism.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bower said that Meghan “suspected Victoria Beckham of indiscretion,” which led to Harry confronting David. “Outraged, Beckham’s truthful denials damaged their relationship,” the royal expert went on, appearing to reference the infamous phone call that severed their friendship for good.</p><p>For now, neither the Beckhams nor Windors have commented on the suspected feuds between their families. But this isn’t the <a href=#>only stark claim that Bower makes in his book</a>. He goes into detail about Harry and Meghan’s relationship with his family, claiming that Meghan made Duchess Kate Middleton cry during dress fittings for her wedding. Moreover, Bower says Queen Elizabeth was relieved when Meghan decided not to return to the U.K. for Prince Phillip’s 2021 funeral.</p><p>Although Harry and Meghan may have relocated to California to escape the publicity they were facing in his native U.K., it appears drama continues to follow them wherever they go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqiusNmraKbpKS%2Fqq2Mm5yco5iWum6t0Z5kmq6fnrGqusZmqK6do6m2sLrSZpifrJWnerOxz6iprZ2UocZur9Stq6Kml2LBqrHSZq6irJhiuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsYyapZ1loKe2r6%2FEZp%2BaqqKufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inspectah-deck-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inspectah Deck Net Worth - Pulptastic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-low-cut-bras-for-every-cup-size.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Low Cut Bras for Every Cup Size From A to DD+</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
