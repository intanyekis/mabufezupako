He shared the news alongside a picture of himself sitting next to Erbert’s hospital bed.</p><p>Erbert, 29, <a href=#>was hospitalized</a> following a performance of Hough’s A Symphony of Dance Tour in Washington, D.C. on December 6. “She was diagnosed with a cranial hematoma from a burst blood vessel and required an emergency craniectomy,” Hough wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> one day later, noting that Erbert was in “stable condition.”</p><p>He continued to <a href=#>share updates</a> on his wife’s health before asking fans to send well-wishes via his Instagram Story ahead of her second operation. “She is going in for surgery this morning to replace a large portion of her skull that was removed during her Craniectomy,” he wrote on Wednesday, December 20. “Please keep her in your prayers as I believe the collective energy helped her through these past few weeks. We love you. We thank you.”</p><p>On Thursday, Hough thanked the “exceptional medical team” who helped restore Erbert’s skull. “Their expertise and steady hands were pivotal in this journey, ensuring a smooth and successful surgery,” he stated. “Especially <strong>Dr. Mai</strong> who not only performed the surgery but was also the one who saved her life 2 weeks ago.”</p><p>The Dancing With the Stars judge also thanked fans for the “outpouring of support and prayers” they’ve shared, adding, “Your thoughts, prayers, and positive energy have been a source of strength and comfort for us during this challenging time. It’s truly heartwarming to know how much love and care surrounds us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Derek-Hough-Says-Wife-Hayley-Erbert-Is-on-Path-to-a-Full-Recovery-After-Successful-Cranioplasty-Surgery-3.jpg><p>Hough said he and his family are “filled with hope and optimism for the future, knowing [Hayley] is on the path to a full recovery, surrounded by such a loving community.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Hough praised his wife via Instagram for showing <a href=#>“strength” and “resilience”</a> following her health scare, <a href=#>sharing a video</a> of the two of them walking along the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the clip, which Hough posted on Friday, December 15, Erbert sported a white and tan helmet on her head while keeping comfy in a fuzzy jacket and sweatpants.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Derek and Erbert began dating in 2015, one year after she joined him and his sister, <strong>Julianne Hough</strong>, on their Move Live Tour. The pair confirmed their <a href=#>engagement</a> in June 2022 and <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in August.</p><p>“How has it already been two months since this magical day?!” Erbert <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned a photo</a> of herself and Hough dancing at their wedding reception in October. “@derekhough I love you so much and I wish we could repeat this day over and over again.
