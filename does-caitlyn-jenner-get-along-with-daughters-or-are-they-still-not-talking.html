Some of <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner's kids don't want to be on TV</a>, which makes sense given the many years that the Kardashian-Jenner family have been in the public eye. Caitlyn Jenner has six children. Caitlyn shares<strong> </strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> and Kendall Jenner with Kris Jenner, and is also the parent of Brandon and Brody Jenner, whom she shares with Linda Thompson. Caitlyn and Chrystie Scott are also parents to Cassandra Marino and Burt Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kardashians are definitely a family who are a huge part of each other's daily lives. But Caitlyn Jenner has had tough times with her children, and many of them have spoken out about not always getting along. What is Caitlyn's connection with her six children like today?</p><h2 id=does-caitlyn-jenner-get-along-with-kylie-and-kendall-jenner>Does Caitlyn Jenner Get Along With Kylie And Kendall Jenner?</h2><p>While the family still shares a lot on the <a href=#>Hulu reality series The Kardashians</a>, fans will always want to know more about what daily life is like for the Kardashian-Jenners. And that includes what bond Caitlyn Jenner actually has with her children.</p><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner have a better relationship</a> than Caitlyn does with Kendall Jenner. According to Buzzfeed News, Caitlyn was interviewed on the Him And Her podcast in 2019 and talked about seeing Kylie regularly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/kylie-jenner-on-a-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caitlyn said, "Kendall's very athletic. We kind of both had the same attitude towards life. I get on very well with the two of them, but Kylie and I just seem to be closer most of the time."</p><p>Caitlyn said quite a lot during that podcast interview. She also called Kendall "secretive" in comparison to her twin sister Kylie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/caitlyn-jenner-1.jpg><p>Caitlyn also said that she and Kylie often had dinner together. She explained, "Kendall's off kind of doing her thing. I had dinner last night at Kylie's house. We try to do that once a week, once every two weeks. I go over there and she always has these great meals prepared. She doesn't do them, but they're so good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Kendall Jenner Missed Her Niece's Birth</a></span></p><p>It doesn't sound like there is any bad blood between Caitlyn and Kendall Jenner. Their personalities just might not mesh as well as Caitlyn and Kylie's do. That, of course, happens in every family. And while Caitlyn's words might have seemed a little bit harsh, she and Kendall don't seem to be fighting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-18.jpg><p>While Caitlyn was honest about how her connection to Kylie is different, she does seem to still care a lot about Kendall. According to Hello! Magazine, Kendall and Caitlyn were photographed spending time together in May 2022, and it looked like they had gone shopping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-caitlyn-jenner-39-s-relationship-with-brody-jenner-like>What Is Caitlyn Jenner's Relationship With Brody Jenner Like?</h2><p>While Caitlyn Jenner gets along well with Kylie Jenner, it doesn't seem like they have a good relationship with their son Brody Jenner today. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brody spoke about Caitlyn not going to his wedding</a>, according to People. Brody married Kaitlynn Carter in June 2018, although the two broke up in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Brody-Jennerand-Kaitlynn-.jpg><p>The couple talked about this on The Hills: New Beginnings and it sounds like it was really painful for both of them. Carter said that right before the wedding, they found out that Caitlyn wouldn't be there.</p><p>Brody said on The Hills reboot, “Not having my dad at the wedding, it was a bummer. Honestly, it really did hurt and I would have loved to have had her there. But she had better things to do. Apparently.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Brody Jenner And Kaitlynn Carter</a></span></p><p>Missing a child's wedding is definitely a big deal. And it makes sense that Brody would be upset about this. It's possible that this decision affected his relationship with Caitlyn for a while after.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/caitlyn-jenner.jpg><p>Brody is now in a serious relationship with Tia Blanco. And in March 2023, they shared that they are expecting a baby, according to Us Weekly. It doesn't appear that Caitlyn has spoken about the good news. And it's unknown if she will be part of Brody's life once he becomes a father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, a source explained to Page Six that while Caitlyn Jenner was considering running for Governor of California, Brody didn't want to talk about it in interviews.</p><p>Brody Jenner hasn't commented on his relationship with Caitlyn more recently. It seems fair to assume that the situation might be the same and he might still be in some pain about Caitlyn not going to his wedding.</p><h2 id=does-caitlyn-jenner-get-along-with-her-other-children-including-burt-and-brandon-jenner>Does Caitlyn Jenner Get Along With Her Other Children, Including Burt And Brandon Jenner?</h2><p>As for whether Caitlyn Jenner is close with her other kids, it sounds like she gets along well with them, and they have a better relationship than she does with Kendall and Brody Jenner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/burt-jenner-baby-1.jpg><p>In 2015, Burt Jenner said that they were a support system for Caitlyn Jenner. Burt explained to Entertainment Tonight they connected. He said, "Just like anybody else in life, all you got is family. So, that’s brought us much closer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Brandon Jenner wrote a book called "To Me, He Was Just Dad" and said he and Caitlyn never saw each other much when he was little. Brandon wrote, “I didn’t see my father more than half a dozen times between the ages eight and twenty-five. Sadly the infrequent exchanges felt more like staged photo opportunities than real bonding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cayley-stoker-brandon-jenner.jpg><p>Brandon said that he felt that the times he did see his parent were all about taking a holiday picture, not because Caitlyn wanted to be a big part of each other's lives.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Janice Dickinson Really Feels About Getting Labelled As The 'Caitlyn Jenner Lookalike'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandon added that as of 2020, he and Caitlyn saw one another more frequently. And Brandon Jenner's story seems to be similar to Cassandra Marino's.</p><p>Caitlyn and Cassandra Marino also seem to be in a happier place than they once were. Cassandra explained to People,</p><p>"My relationship with Caitlyn is much better ... but we still have a lot of work to do. We didn't talk for years, and now we see each other every couple of weeks and talk on the phone, which I am grateful for."</p><p>It sounds like there are still some hurt feelings among Caitlyn Jenner's children. And that definitely makes sense since it can take a long time to process these types of situations. As everyone knows, whether they are as famous as the Kardashian-Jenners are or not, sometimes family has trouble getting along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrCitdOlsKdlmpq7r7HRZp6erF2WubC6xmauoqyYYrGiwcahq56qo2K8s3nAq5xmrJiaxm6%2F06KjpWWepMFuwMCloqKml2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-gleb-savchenko-single-is-he-dating-shangela-relationship-timeline-490755-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Gleb Savchenko Single?
