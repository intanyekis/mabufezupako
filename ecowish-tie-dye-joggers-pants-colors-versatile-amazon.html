It had a huge re-emergence over the past year, especially when everyone was in DIY mode over the summer, but it’s not like it was even missing before that. It’s such a unique yet consistent design in our lives, and there are just so many ways to do it!</p><p>You probably already love tie-dye, but we want to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">open your eyes up to it even more</a>. A lot of people view tie-dye as solely casual. They love it on T-shirts, <a href=# data-link=1>sweats</a> and pajamas — and we do too, of course. There is a way to make it a little fancier too though! If you combine the right dye techniques with the right silhouette and colors, you could be dressing up your tie-dye in no time. We’re not saying to do it yourself, of course. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">These ECOWISH joggers</a> have already taken care of it!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ECOWISH Snakeskin Tie Dye Joggers</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> at Amazon!

Pattern aside, these bottoms also have a high-rise adjustable drawstring waistband and a cropped, tapered ankle, elevating the look (while also leaving room for some strappy shoes).</p><p>Part of why we love these pants is because they’re multi-seasonal. They’re long, but they’re light enough to be worn on breezy spring and summer days. And even though we typically tend to associate tie-dye with summer in general, these joggers don’t scream any specific season. They’re very versatile!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ECOWISH Snakeskin Tie Dye Joggers</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> at Amazon!

If you want to dress them up, then why not? Slip on a pair of high heels and tuck a button-up top into the waistband, or perhaps a silky cami. You can easily picture the outfit because it just works that well. When it’s cold, we also love the idea of pairing it with a fitted turtleneck sweater and heeled booties. Don’t forget to layer on the necklaces!</p><p>The possibilities open up even more when you take the different <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">available colors</a> into account. There are five: black, blue, green, purple and red, all pairing up with white for that luminous effect we’re obsessed with. Now we just have to pick our favorite!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ECOWISH Snakeskin Tie Dye Joggers</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$24</a> at Amazon!
