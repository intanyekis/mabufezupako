This is proved by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunion special</a>&nbsp;called "The One Where They Get Back Together,"&nbsp;that is airing on HBO Max, starting on Thursday, May 27. Could we BE anymore excited?! The long awaited reunion was supposed to happen last year, but due to the pandemic it got pushed back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Courteney Cox, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry all reunited on the Warner Bros. lot this past spring for a loose unscripted format, featuring many guest stars. They are not playing their characters, but coming as themselves and reflecting on the time they were on the show.</p><p>When the trailer dropped, fans were emotional, but they also noticed Matthew Perry, who played Chandler Bing, seemed a bit off. He was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slurring his words</a> and didn't look well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were concerned</a> and expressed that on social media. Here is everything fans are saying about Matthew Perry since the Friends reunion.</p><h2 id=he-had-a-stroke><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Had A Stroke</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the trailer for the Friends reunion at one point, it looks like Matthew Perry is slurring his words and he's sitting down, not looking well. Slurred speech is a big symptom of a stroke, so fans were worried something was wrong. However, his team confirmed that the day of the reunion Perry had to have an emergency tooth procedure, which impacted his well-being. He had been in a lot of pain.</p><h2 id=he-looks-sick><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Looks Sick</span></h2><p>However, fans noticed not only was he slurring his speech, but he also just looked sick in the trailer and in his Instagram post promoting the new shirts and hoodies for the reunion that he looked unwell. Perry has had a lot of problems in the past, so fans were worried he relapsed again. But he is not sick after all. In fact, he is just aging, like everyone does when they get older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drugs-and-alcohol-have-taken-a-toll><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Drugs And Alcohol Have Taken A Toll</span></h2><p>It is a well-known fact that Matthew Perry has struggled with drugs and alcohol. In fact, while he was on Friends,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic</a> in 1997 and 2001, according to The Sun.&nbsp;In an interview with PEOPLE in 2013, he told them, "I had a big problem with alcohol and pills and I couldn't stop." Fans took notice of his not there state and thought he maybe relapsed again.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Throwback Pictures Of Matthew Perry Too Good To Ignore&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=it-pains-me-to-see-him-like-this><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>It Pains Me To See Him Like This</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clip posted to PEOPLE's website</a> with the three men talking about the show and the reunion. At one point in the interview, Matthew Perry slurred his words again and one fans tweeted, "It pains me to see Matthew Perry like this, he just seems off, gazing at the void, speaking slowly.” Another fan wrote that they were sad and "scared like hell for Matthew Perry." It's nice to see fans concerned, but making wrong assumptions can take a toll on someone.</p><h2 id=he-looks-so-great-and-healthy><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Looks So Great And Healthy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other side of things, one fan took to Twitter with a picture from PEOPLE magazine to say he "he looks so great and healthy. They all look amazing!" When the show ended in 2004, they were all still in their 30's at the prime of their careers and lives. They've all aged significantly. It's nice to see celebrities aging naturally instead of them getting cosmetic surgeries and trying to still look young.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of The Ups And Downs Of Matthew Perry's Career&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=be-respectful-he-s-been-through-a-lot><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Be Respectful He's Been Through A Lot</span></h2><p>A fan on Twitter, who has Chandler Bing as their profile picture, told others who were spreading rumors about Matthew Perry to "be respectful." People age and "Matthew has been through a lot since Friends wrapped."</p><p>And they're right. Even though fans didn't know he had a procedure on his mouth that same day, it's not right to spread rumors and be judgmental because it could cause him to relapse again, especially if he sees the comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Things About Matthew Perry's Time On 'Friends'&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-being-insensitive-over-merchandise><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He's Being Insensitive Over Merchandise</span></h2><p>To celebrate to reunion, Matthew Perry partnered with "Represent" to release some limited edition Chandler Bing/Friends merch. But some fans found it insensitive. Because he had a shirt that said 'Could I BE Anymore Vaccinated?' making a spoof on how Chandler emphasized the BE when he talked. Fans found it insensitive and thought he was making fun of COVID and the 100,000s of people who lost their lives. Other fans came to his defense and bought the shirts as soon as they got their shots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-grateful><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Be Grateful</span></h2><p>Because Perry has been through a lot, fans on Twitter are telling the ones who are putting him down to be grateful that he is even at the reunion and that he is alive to be here. People are just concerned about his looks, when the man has aged like the rest of the cast, and they don't really know what he has gone through or is going through. They just want fans to be grateful that he even got to come and do this. Be sure to tune into HBO Max to watch the six friends reunite.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry And David Schwimmer Have Been Up To Since Friends Ended</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZqqasZmjtG6twaisrWWdlsG1tMSwZKmdoqfGbr%2FIp5qeZaSdsm6y0aKcp5yjYr%2Bmwc2ipqdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-pastore-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Heartbreaking Tragedy!
