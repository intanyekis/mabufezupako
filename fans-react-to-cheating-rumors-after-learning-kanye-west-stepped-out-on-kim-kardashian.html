On the contrary. Closer examination of the words has now led fans to believe that this song is an admission of his guilt, his infidelity, and of him being the reason that Kimye seized to be.</p><p>Understandably, Twitter has erupted.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-39-s-revealing-lyrics>Kanye West's Revealing Lyrics</h2><p>Donda was supposed to be released much sooner than it was,and West revealed not one, but <a href=#>three listening parties </a>to tease fans along the way. After many delayed release dates, fans were finally able to sink their teeth into the lyrics and the beats of Kanye West's most highly anticipated album. While they were doing so, critics pulled some lyrics out of Hurricane that seem to not be about Irina Shayk at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lyrics are; “Here I go actin’ too rich / Here I go with a new chick / And I know what the truth is / Still playin’ after two kids / It’s a lot to digest when your life always movin’.”</p><p>Kanye has made reference to his inability to remain faithful before, namely in his 2010 song, Runaway, in which he says; "See, I could have me a good girl, And still be addicted to them hood rats, And I just blame everything on you, At least you know that's what I'm good at.."</p><p>Now that the lyrics are about cheating on Kim Kardashian while married, fans are really paying attention and digging deeper to learn more.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To Soulja Boy Trolling Kanye West For Being With Kim Kardashian First</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-are-tuned-in-to-kimye-controversy>Fans Are Tuned In To Kimye Controversy</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are not impressed by Kanye West, in spite of his admission to guilt and this semblance of an apology. They've taken to social media to rant about this current situation by saying; "whoa, what the hell" and "he cheated on his baby mama after two kids? that's just messed up," and "talk about a mess. he can't keep faithful at all."</p><p>Others wrote; "poor Kim. she kept it classy by not trolling him over this," and "why would he get married and have all those babies if that's not the life he wanted? he can literally do anything he wants, yet he cheats. that's weak."</p><p>A fan with a difference in perspective revealed; "The Kardashian Curse hits again,"and "the Kardashians don't exactly set the bar very high for themselves anyway."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Is Kimye Still Happening?
