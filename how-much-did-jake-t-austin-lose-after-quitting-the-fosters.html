Austin?</a></li></ul><p>Since there are so many famous actors these days, people seem to rarely think about how strange their job truly is. After all, when was the last time people talked about the fact that the top actors get paid millions to pretend to be other people?On top of that, it is really strange that many actors have to deal with barely <a href=#>missing out on the role of a lifetime</a>. With that in mind, it makes sense that a lot of actors hang on to every notable job they get tooth and nail. After all, they have no idea when or if they will get another successful role.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This 'Modern Family' Actor Has The Longest Sitcom Resume Ever</a></span>Amazingly enough, famous actors sometimes leave a famous role of their own free will. A perfect example of that is when Jake T. Austin shocked fans of The Fosters by quitting the show before the third season began filming.In the past, some people have suggested that <a href=#>Austin's career was ruined due to his Wizards of Waverly Place role</a>. While that is very debatable, one thing semms clear, Austin lost a lot of money due to his decision to leave The Fosters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-jake-t-austin-leave-the-fosters>Why Did Jake T. Austin Leave The Fosters?</h2><p>When couples break up or someone gets fired, there typically are three different versions of events. After all, the two people involved both tend to have their own version and then there is the truth. As a result, it certainly was possible that fans would never learn the true reason why Jake T. Austin left The Fosters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Little-Known Details About The Making Of The Fosters</a></span></p><p>Thankfully for fans of The Fosters and Austin, they did wind up getting a good picture of why he left the show. After all, everyone involved seems to have a pretty similar version of events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While promoting The Fosters' third season, Austin's former co-stars were asked about the situation. In response, David Lambert explained that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin quit because he and the show's producers weren't on the same page</a>. “I think it was a classic case of he didn’t see eye to eye.”</p><p>Later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin weighed in on his departure from The Fosters</a> and his explanation was consistent with Lambert's statement. “I just wanted to do roles with more substantive content.” “I was only asked to return for 3 episodes and wasn’t going to be able to work on anything else, so I left…”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-quitting-the-fosters-cost-jake-t-austin>How Much Money Did Quitting The Fosters Cost Jake T. Austin?</h2><p>When lead actors decide to quit a show, producers have two options, replace them or remove their character. When the character is removed, it can be very difficult to figure out how much money the departing actor missed out on. However, when the actor is replaced, that can be a lot easier to quantify.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Every Reason For The Cast Changes On 'Last Man Standing'</a></span></p><p>Since Jake T. Austin's The Fosters role was recast, it is pretty easy to get a decent idea of some of the money he missed out on due to that decision.</p><p>After Austin left The Fosters, Noah Centineo was hired to take over portraying Jesus Foster for The Fosters' final three seasons. Even though <a href=#>Centineo has gone on to land many notable roles</a> in recent years, back then he was a mostly unknown actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Centineo wasn't a big star when he starred in The Fosters, ABC Family didn't need to pay him a fortune to star in the show. According to a 2019 Seventeen article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Centineo reportedly was paid between 16k and 18k per episode of The Fosters</a> during his three-season tenure.</p><p>Considering that Centineo is credited with appearing in 53 episodes of The Fosters on IMDb, that means he was paid between $848,000 and $954,000 if Seventeen's report is accurate.</p><p>Even though Austin once explained that he was only asked to return for three episodes, it is entirely possible his tenure would have been extended to match Centineo's time on the show. If that was the case, Austin clearly missed out on a lot of money and there are other things to consider as well.</p><p>First off, keeping in mind the fact that Austin was more famous before he was cast in The Fosters, his salary for the show may have been higher than what Centineo got paid. As a result, the figure Austin missed out on could be even higher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, since Centineo has landed several notable roles since his The Fosters tenure, it is theoretically possible that Austin could have gone on to greater success if he continued to star in the show.</p><p>As it is, Austin's career since The Fosters has comprised of a few voice-over roles and parts in two movies that a lot of people haven't heard of. Austin also competed in a season of Dancing with the Stars but was eliminated first.</p><p>In short, Austin's career's hasn't been on fire since leaving The Fosters. As a result, in the scenario that continuing to star in the show led to other roles for him, he missed out on even more money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lmpa4pnnTZpiuq6Seu264zqycZpmWqbKzedCuoK2smaO0bsDHnmSfp6OpsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-barry-sobel-make-latest-barry-sobel-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Barry Sobel Make?
