Though his career has been a series of ups and downs, it’s perhaps his run ins with the IRS and outspoken stance on the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">legalization of marijuana</a> that has kept Nelson in the news for the past several decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 88-year-old superstar is loved by many and according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, has $25 million to his name.</p><p>How did Nelson earn his fortune and how does he choose to spend it today?</p><h2 id=songwriter-for-the-masses>Songwriter For The Masses</h2><p>In the 1960’s Nelson was unable to find a record label to sign him, even though unbeknownst to the label executives, he was <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">churning out hits right and left</a>. Nelson sold “Pretty Paper” to Roy Orbison, “Night Life” to Ray Price and most famously, “Crazy” to Patsy Cline.</p><p>Despite other singers’ success, Nelson’s personal recordings were often turned away. He was told he didn’t fit the traditional Nashville music scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=making-it-big>Making It Big</h2><p>By 1973, Nelson released what many consider one of his best albums, “Shotgun Willie” and then “Phases and Stages” shortly after but neither made the charts. It wasn’t until 1975, when “Red-Headed Stranger” reached <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">No. 1 on the country charts </a>and as luck would have it, the Top 40 charts as well. Country fans as well as music fans as a whole had finally discovered Nelson.</p><p>“Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain” earned Nelson his first <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Grammy Award</a> for best country vocal performance. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, Nelson does it again when he joins Waylon Jennings in the duet, “Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys”, winning a second Grammy Award. Following that success, in 1978, Nelson earned another Grammy for “Georgia on My Mind” and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">12 Celebs Making Profit With The Marijuana Business</a></span></p><h2 id=a-film-star>A Film Star</h2><p>Now that Nelson had become a household name, he began appearing in a variety of films. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, “The Electric Horseman” put the country star alongside Robert Redford and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jane Fonda</a>. He starred in the 1986 western drama, “Red Headed Stranger” and has continued this path, appearing in 2005’s remake of “The Dukes of Hazzard”, 2007’s “Blonde Ambition” and 2008’s “Beer for My Horses”.</p><p>Nelson’s famous voice and likeable personality has landed him dozens of roles as himself in films and television. He lent his talent in 2016’s “Zoolander 2” much to his fans delight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=writing-it-down>Writing It Down</h2><p>Nelson wrote his first book in 1988, “Willie: An Autobiography”. An updated <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">autobiography </a>was released in 2012, “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings from the Road.” Between the two autobiographies, Nelson continued to write. For example, Nelson co-authored a “Farm Aid: A Song for America” commemorative book supporting Farm Aid. Nelson has also released books in support of the reduction of gas emissions and in favor of bio-diesel fuel. In 2006, he released another book with long-time friend Turk Pipkin, “The Tao of Willie: A Guide to the Happiness in Your Heart”.</p><p>In 2015, a third autobiography was released, “It’s a Long Story: My Life” co-authored with David Ritz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=real-estate-interests>Real Estate Interests</h2><p>The famous country legend isn’t famous for house flipping, but he has spent a substantial amount of funds for his privacy and quiet retreats. Nelson owns an 800-acre ranch known as “Luck Ranch” in Spicewood, TX. The ranch serves as a horse rescue facility, allowing the animals to live the rest of their lives happy and provided for.</p><p>He has <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">a second home in Maui </a>and is actively engaged in the community. He’s known to stop by Charley’s Restaurant & Saloon to play a few songs for the guests. He’s also participated in a student-led rally on the island to end gun violence.</p><h2 id=commercial-endorsements>Commercial Endorsements</h2><p>Nelson has no problem adding his name to those he agrees with, including <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Presidential endorsements</a>, commercial endorsements and those issues he’s particularly passionate about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, he became the spokesperson for restaurant chain, Texas Roadhouse. He later formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel or “Bio-Willie” along with several business partners to market bio-diesel fuel at truck stops. Today, the biofuel is still sold on the islands of Maui and Hawaii.</p><p>In addition, Nelson <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">created his own marijuana brand</a>, Willie’s Reserve with plans to open chain stores in states where marijuana is legalized.</p><h2 id=activism>Activism</h2><p>Nelson has spent a pretty penny supporting those causes he holds dear. Raised on a farm and a huge supporter for those living a farmer’s life, the “Always on My Mind” singer helped organize the first Farm Aid concert along with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, earning $10 million to help farmers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s been involved in the Society for Protective Animal Legislation, Best Friends Animal Society and Animal Welfare Institute.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">10 Must-See Beachfront Restaurants In Hawaii</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Biography</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMsKClpJmaeq%2Bxy6ymp2WSmrCiucRmmGabn6q7tb7YZqSuq5mYeq2xxp6lnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristen-doute.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristen Doute News - Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-sedaris-siblings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Sedaris Siblings: The Siblings Who Shaped a Humorist</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
