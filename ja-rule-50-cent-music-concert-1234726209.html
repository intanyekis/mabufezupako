Footage surfaced of Fif’s seismic 2002 smash “In Da Club” blaring through the speakers while Ja was preparing for his set at the Power 106.9 Jingle Jam concert in Omaha, Nebraska.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A fan attending the show, which took place on Dec. 10 at the Baxter Arena, shared a clip of members of Ja’s team scrambling to get the song taken off while voicing his amusement at the seemingly intended snafu. “Only in Omaha they gon’ play 50 at Ja Rule sh*t,” the concert-goer said. “They trying to get it cut off right now… That ni**a 50’s still winning!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the background, voices can be heard stating their displeasure, with one person demanding for the DJ to “cut that sh*t off.” Another attendee also commented on the blooper via social media, writing, “Ja Rule out there 20 years later and still getting done in by <a href=# id=auto-tag_50-cent data-tag=50-cent>50 Cent</a>” in the caption of their own tweet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ja Rule appearing to be trolled with his arch-nemesis’ music is just the latest instance of the rap legend being reminded of his beef with Fif by proxy of a performance. In 2018, The Murder Inc. rapper shot down claims that Fif <a href=#>purchased 200 tickets</a> to one of his shows in order to keep the front rows empty.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Even the thought of it is still stupid, because ni**a, all you did if you did that, was put money in my pocket.,” Rule <a href=# rel=nofollow>said at the time</a>. “And what you think the promoter is going to do? Have an empty venue? You let ni**as in free or charge them again! It’s the dumbest sh*t ever, yo. But yeah, it’s cap. Never happened.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While the bad blood between the two continues to run deep, both artists have been enjoying big wins as of late. Last November, Rule’s <a href=#>ICONN Live App</a> debuted on Apple TV, while 50’s Starz series BMF recently aired its Season 2 premiere this past Friday (Jan. 6).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Bubr7UpZxmbWBisKa602akrquZmHqku82cnKusXWZ%2FdICWa21raGlk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./montana-tucker-american-singer-and-actress-net-worth-age-bio-wiki-career-family-nationality-ethnicity-partner-photos-and-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Montana Tucker American Singer and Actress | Net Worth, Age, Bio, Wiki, Career, Family, National</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bugzy-malone-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-186372-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bugzy Malone Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
