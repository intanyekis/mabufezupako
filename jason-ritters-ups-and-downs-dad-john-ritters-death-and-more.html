It was messy and interesting and weird. But mixed in [with] the mix was — I was dealing with some alcoholism issues.”</p><p>The California native explained that <a href=#>he didn’t feel like he “deserved” Lynskey</a> during their initial courtship. But <a href=#>after giving up alcohol</a> in late 2013, he began to reexamine his potential to be a good partner.</p><p>“It was only after maybe a year into not drinking where I started to go, ‘Oh, maybe I can promise some things to someone else. Maybe I can be this person,’” he shared, getting emotional. “I knew that she was incredible. It was working on myself enough to feel like <a href=#>maybe I could be The One for her too.</a>”</p><p>Ritter and the Togetherness alum <a href=#>got engaged in 2017</a> before <a href=#>spontaneously tying the knot</a> on their front porch in 2020. The <a href=#>duo welcomed their daughter</a>, whose name has not been publicly revealed, in 2018.</p><p>The You’re Not You actor shared a glimpse into how fatherhood had transformed him on <a href=#>his first Father’s Day</a> in June 2019.</p><p>“I’m putting this here as a record of my gratitude to my daughter who is making this the best #FathersDay in quite a while and to @melanielynskey <a href=#>who has changed my life forever</a> in the best way. I’m so lucky to have you both in my life,” he wrote via Twitter at the time.</p><p>The New York University alum lost his own father, actor <a href=#>John Ritter</a>, when the Three’s Company alum <a href=#>died suddenly of aortic dissection</a> in 2003. He was 54.</p><p>During an August 2020 conversation with<a href=# rel=noopener> ET Canada</a>, Jason revealed the “main thing” he learned from his parents that he continues to pass down to his daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“A huge thing from my dad and mom [<strong>Nancy Morgan</strong>] is how they always made sure we knew we were loved,” he shared. “They said it a million times. You can pass all kinds of stuff onto your kids, but the feeling of being loved, unconditionally, is so important — <a href=#>knowing you can mess up or fail</a> and they’ll never go, ‘Well, we loved you until that moment. Too bad!’”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Ritter’s ups and downs over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K%2Fzqdkq6GkqbKzv4yup6xlkaOxbrDOsKWsZZSWsW62zqGlZqqZqcGmvtJmm56ZpJ16orrDZqSoqpVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-booed-at-her-friends-wedding.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Handled The Boos At Her Friend's Wedding In The Best Way Possible</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./howie-mandel-sofia-vergaras-divorce-joke-walked-off-americas-got-talent-stage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Howie Mandel's Jokes About Sofia Vergara's Divorce Were So Uncomfortable That She Walked Off America</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
