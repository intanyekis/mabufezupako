For four-time Emmy award-winning Survivor host and producer <strong><a href=#>Jeff Probst</a></strong>, it's all in a day's work.</p><p>The 52-year-old personality shared a preview photo from his upcoming cameo on CBS' Two and a Half Men on Twitter Wednesday, Nov. 13 — and it looks like Probst ditched his beloved blue shirt for his birthday suit.</p><p>Completely nude and carrying a tray of bacon, the super-fit Survivor staple <a href=#>explained</a> to the Today show that his guest appearance on the sitcom was one where he was "playing a version" of himself. "I just jokingly mean that I'm not typically walking around naked with a plate of bacon," he said. "I don't really eat bacon."</p><p>The veteran television host continued, "I got a call from the casting director. I happen to be friends with [<strong>Jon</strong>]<strong> Cryer</strong> and I texted him and he said, 'I just read the script. It’s really funny. You should do it.' " Probst was then told that he would be naked. "Getting to work with stars with the magnitude of Cryer and <a href=#><strong>Ashton </strong>[<strong>Kutcher</strong></a>] on a show of this magnitude created by one of the biggest TV creators of all time — and be naked. That will go down in the scrapbook," he added.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It was fun to put myself in that position," he shared. "It’s also fun to make fun of yourself. Really, seriously, who is going to turn down a chance to be on that show? I’m all in."</p><p>As for prepping for his big moment, Probst admitted that he actually did not have the luxury of time like most actors who strip down for scenes. "It’s not like they called in June and said 'Hey, in November, we’d like to use you.' It was like 48 hours later we were shooting," he explained. "I definitely put effort into staying fit."</p><p>With one look at his rock hard abs, there is no debating that! The episode will air on Thursday, Nov. 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGenpZivbO7wayrZqukp7axv4ydprCmXaOurLHDZqqisqqhsrR51qKroWWSlrCwuoyipWasp6R6orrDZphmoJGhs265xKdkqaqforxuvMicZGtoYWh%2BdX2QaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meldrick-taylor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meldrick Taylor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-glassman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Glassman Wikipedia, Bikini, Age, Parents</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
