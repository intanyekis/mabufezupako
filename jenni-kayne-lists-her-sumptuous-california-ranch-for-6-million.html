She became known for her cozy wardrobe essentials, like cashmere sweaters, shoes, and accessories. In 2017, she expanded into homeware with furniture, decor, and accessories, and she also founded skincare line Oak Essentials in 2021. All of her pieces are inspired by the laid-back California lifestyle, with a neutral color palette; comfortable yet elegant silhouettes; and natural materials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED</b><a href=#><b>: </b></a><a href=#><b>Mark Zuckerberg Little League Card With Signature Sold For Over $100,000 At Auction</b></a></span></p><p>Her latest endeavor? Home design. The Jenni Kayne Ranch, which is now on the market for $5.995 million, was first her family’s weekend escape from Los Angeles before she decided to sell. When she stepped into the beautiful ranch home in Santa Ynez, California in January 2020, she saw immediate potential for a project. The potential, however, required a bit of a vision.</p><p>“This home had been abandoned since the 1970s and was near disrepair,” Kayne tells <i>Forbes</i> . “It required extensive renovations, but I saw potential from the moment I walked in. My team and I took the property down to the studs, rebuilding every detail to create a space that really celebrated the essence of California living. We opened up the living spaces to create an effortless flow, lifted the ceilings, and brightened up each room. We made sure that each window came with views of the Santa Ynez Valley,” per <a href=#><i>Forbes</i></a> .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home required extensive renovations, that took nearly two years to complete. But with such a desirable location in Woodstock Ranch community, just 2.5 hours outside of Los Angeles and 30 minutes from Santa Barbara, and with nearby access to wineries, outdoor pursuits, and charming towns, she knew it was possible.</p><p>The finished project is a 3,860-square-foot home with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, and the home is situated on 20 acres of gated land. When designing the home, she envisioned it as a relaxing sanctuary for her own family and friends. The home prioritizes indoor-outdoor living, and the natural landscape never feels too far away. There are 360-degree views of the Santa Ynez Mountains through floor-to-ceiling windows, as well as private patios accessible from the bedrooms, kitchen, and living room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The open, single-story floor plan has a Plain English eat-in chef’s kitchen, living room, outdoor living area, and pool and spa just steps outside the home. Kayne’s design style is instantly recognizable in this home: a palette of white and off-white hues; earthy; and full of sumptuous textures and materials. Of course, the ultra-private escape is outfitted with Kayne’s furniture and home lines (that can be purchased with the home for an additional cost), as well as Parachute bedding and her own Oak Essentials bath products.</p><p>“We’re constantly inspired by the notions of California living and nature—both of which are embodied at the Jenni Kayne Ranch,” she says. “The embrace of indoor-outdoor living at the Ranch inspired our outdoor collection, the Vista Collection, as well as a few additional upcoming outdoor pieces that will be launching in 2023. The abundance of natural materials also inspired a handful of accent pieces, like our soon-to-launch Ranch Stump and Planter, which are made from suar wood.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to expanding her skincare, clothing, and home offerings—she recently opened showrooms in New York and Los Angeles—Kayne is looking to IPO by 2024 under the Pacific Group. This comes after immense success in all categories, but especially Jenni Kayne Home, which is expected to reach $100 million in sales by 2024. The redesign of the ranch is just the first of many hospitality-driven projects. Her company recently partnered with Auberge Resorts Collection property, The Inn at Mattei’s Tavern, where her skincare line will be included in the spa. She also curated the interiors at the Te Arai Golf Resort in New Zealand, and also has plans for a Jenni Kayne hotel down the road.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>:</b></a><a href=#><b>Kanye West Allegedly Played His Sex Tapes For Yeezy Employees, They Claim in Open Letter to Adidas</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Forbes</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajnZ6jtm63wLKlnmWcnsC1v4yhnKtlo6q6scDUqKysZZOWuaqyzqulopldp66vr8dmnaiqXWt6rrXLpaCopl8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./suge-knight-snoop-dogg-2pac-downfall-death-1234872371.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Suge Knight Blames Snoop Dogg For 2Pac's &amp;quot;Downfall&amp;quot; And Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-barry-sobel-make-latest-barry-sobel-net-worth-income-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Barry Sobel Make?
