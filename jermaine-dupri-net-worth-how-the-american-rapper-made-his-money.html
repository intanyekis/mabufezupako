He has also produced hits for iconic singers such as Usher, Mariah Carey, and Nelly.</p><h2><strong>What is Jermaine Dupri’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Jermaine Dupri has a net worth of $2 million. His primary source of income is his music career which dates back to 1990 when he was just about 18 years. Beyond music royalties and production fees, Jermaine Dupri is also an astute businessman. He has diversified his interests to vegan foods, athletes’ management, and even vodka drinks.</p><h2><strong>How Jermaine Dupri’s Net Worth Accrued</strong></h2><h3><strong>His Music Production Career</strong></h3><p>One of the major sources of Jermaine Dupris’s net worth is his illustrious career as a music producer. Dupri began producing songs as an 18-year-old in 1992. Since then, he has steadily built up a reputation as one of the most sought-after producers in hip-hop and R&B. To date, he has produced whole albums and hit songs for the likes of Usher and Mariah Carey.</p><p>He co-wrote and produced several tracks for Usher which has made it to the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. They are Burn, “Confessions Part II”, and “My Boo. He has also worked with Usher on multiple albums that went platinum. These include Confessions (2004) and My Way (1997).</p><p>Another artist that Jermaine Dupri has worked closely with is Mariah Carey. He has produced tracks on several of her albums such as Me. I Am Mariah, The Elusive Chanteuse, Here I Stand, E=MC2, and The Emancipation Of Mimi. He has also worked with her on multiple hit songs such as We Belong Together and Always Be My Baby.</p><p>Jermaine Dupri has also produced tracks for the likes of Nelly, Ashanti, Fabolous, Tamar Braxton, and Bow Wow. For producing these tracks, Jermaine Dupri will earn a flat fee running into six figures. He will then make even greater money from <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">royalties</a> of about 15% to 20% on the songs. These royalties are even more valuable than the flat fee. They accumulate over time and one can use them as collateral for loans just as Dupri has done in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Jermaine-Dupri.jpg><p><strong>He Also Runs His Own Record Label Known as So So Def Recordings</strong></p><p>Jermaine Dupri also owns a record label known as So So Def Records. He established the record label in 1993 and has had some great artists on the bill over the years. One of them is the hip-hop duo known as Kris Kross (comprising Chris Kelly and Chris Smith). Dupri discovered them and turned them into a successful act. They dropped three studio albums with their first studio album, 1992’s Totally Krossed Out, going platinum.</p><p>Another successful artist that Jermaine Dupri discovered and signed to his label is the female R&B group, Xscape. The group comprised singers such as Kandi Burruss, Tameka Cottle, LaTocha Scott, Tamera Coggins-Wynn, and Tamika Scott. The group also dropped successful albums with their debut album, 1993’s Hummin’ Comin’ at ‘Cha, going platinum.</p><p>Another So So Def signee that has churned out platinum albums is Da Brat, a female rapper. Her debut album, Funkdafied (1994), sold one million copies, making her the first female solo rap act to receive a platinum certification. Running a record label gives Jermaine Dupri the opportunity to make money through music sales, music performances/ concerts, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">licensing</a> of songs for films, video games, merchandise sales, etc.</p><h4><strong>He is also a Rapper with Several Hit Songs to his Name</strong></h4><p>Jermaine Dupri not only makes money from the music he produces for other people but also his own music as well. The record producer is also a talented rapper. He has dropped two solo albums and four compilation albums. His first solo album, Life in 1472 (1998), went platinum meaning that it sold at least a million copies. The outright sales figures as well as the cumulative royalties would have undoubtedly contributed to Dupri’s net worth.</p><h3><strong>Jermaine Dupri is the Co-Owner of the Vodka Brand Known as 3 Vodka Distilling Company</strong></h3><p>Jermaine Dupri is not just a talented record producer but also an astute businessman. Amongst his business interests is a vodka company known as 3 Vodka Distilling Company. 3 Vodka Distilling Company is distinctive. They produce their vodka from soy, which has no carbohydrates or fat. It was this fact that impressed Jermaine Dupri about the brand and he decided to get involved so as to introduce it to wider audiences.</p><p>3 Vodka Distilling Company is reputed as the only vodka in the world to receive the first flawless vodka rating of 100 points. It is the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">first</a> spirit to receive government approval to list no carbohydrates on its packaging.</p><h3><strong>He also Owns a Vegan Ice Cream Brand</strong></h3><p>Jermaine Dupri is also the owner of a vegan ice cream brand such as JD’s Vegan. The record producer has been a vegan for two decades and has immensely benefited from it. He, therefore, decided to share the health benefits with others through his vegan ice cream brand. The ice cream brand features <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">gluten-free</a>, plant-based, and non-GMO frozen desserts.</p><p>The brand has creative and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">enjoyable</a> names for its treats such as Welcome to Atlanta, Peach Cobbler, Apple Butter, Strawberry Sweetheart, Chocolate My Way, Key Lime Pie, and (404) Cookies & Cream. They are carried by Walmart Stores and retail for under $30 million.</p><h3><strong>Jermaine Dupri Previously Floated a Sports Management Agency</strong></h3><p>Back in 1999, Jermaine Dupri decided to delve into the sports management industry. He wanted to use his expertise to make stars out of athletes and set up a sports management agency named So So Def Sports. The brand was able to attract more than a dozen athletes including NFL stars such as Dorsey Levens (Green Bay Packers Pro Bowl running back), Tyrone Poole (Indianapolis Colts cornerback), and Lethon Flowers (Pittsburgh Steelers safety).</p><p>They helped the athletes to take care of issues such as endorsement deals, contract negotiation, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">personal and legal services</a>, and marketing. They also covered post-career planning, an area that is a knotty issue for most pros. So So Def Sports made some money but it seems that the company is no longer in existence.</p><h4><strong>Sources of Jermaine Dupri’s Net Worth</strong></h4><ul><li>Royalties from music production</li><li>Income from So So Def Records</li><li>Vodka company</li><li>Vegan ice cream brand</li><li>Income from the athlete management agency</li></ul><h2><strong>Jermaine Dupri Has Encountered Money Problems Which Has Led To Multiple Law Suits</strong></h2><p>Jermaine Dupri has certainly enjoyed a thriving and lucrative career and is now living the life of the rich and famous. That is, however, not to say that he has not had some money problems in the past. He was once indicted by the state for failure to pay his taxes. He was then forced to settle a $3 million tax lien in February 2013.</p><p>Back in 2012, Jermain Dupri’s Atlanta mansion was nearly foreclosed. This arose from his failure to meet up with required payments but he later dealt with the situation. Fast-forward to May 2013, a bank known as Sun Trust sued Dupri for failure to fully repay a $4.8 million loan. They claimed that he had paid about $2.8 leaving $2 million and interests unpaid. Dupri described the lawsuit as <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">bogus</a>.</p><p>Jermaine Dupri was also<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> sued</a> for $1 million in 2014 by a business partner named Eddie Weathers. Weathers claimed that he and Dupri had opened a music company together with an agreement to split the profits from royalties. He claimed that Dupri only gave him $275,752.97 and no more. The outcome of this lawsuit is not known but it is likely that the parties settled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC2xKukmqGemnqlwc%2BroGamlal6uLvRrZ9moJ%2BserW0xGaYpp2inrCiuoyrmKmolad6rq3DnmShoaNiurC6xLJm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacqueline-arenal-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-295648-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacqueline Arenal Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-arlook-interview-big-time-adolescence-grown-ish.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Arlook Interview On Big Time Adolescence &amp;amp; Grown-ish Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
