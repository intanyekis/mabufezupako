He completed the program and continued his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">battle</a>&nbsp;with sobriety as an outpatient.&nbsp;</p><p>A representative for Mulaney <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> the news to Page Six.&nbsp;They said the comedian will not make any comments and focus on his recovery and getting back to work. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Meanwhile, his now ex-wife Tendler also spoke through her representative, expressing that she is heartbroken about Mulaney’s decision to end their marriage&nbsp;and wished him support and success as he continued his recovery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Mulaney Always Spoke Fondly of Tendler</h2><p>Although the reason for their divorce is still unknown, fans know&nbsp;how during&nbsp;their nearly seven-year marriage, Mulaney spoke of Tendler ever so&nbsp;fondly. The two first met during a group trip to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>From then on, Mulaney frequently cracked jokes about her in his stand-up shows and interviews. In his 2012 stand-up special New In Town, Mulaney <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned</a> that he liked dating Jewish woman and their communication style, clearly a nod to&nbsp;Tendler.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During his 2018 Netflix special John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City, he noted that Tendler&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">permitted</a> him to make fun of her but requested not to call her [expletive]. He did exactly that and added that she was the best and called her his hero. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;Big Mouth&nbsp;star also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spoke</a> on Tendler’s behalf on Twitter in April 2020 while debunking pregnancy rumors. He wrote that someone had asked his wife if she was pregnant after seeing her in&nbsp;Pay Attention.</p><p>To celebrate the debut of Mulaney’s Netflix special&nbsp;John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch,&nbsp;Mulaney took&nbsp;to Instagram and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">gushed&nbsp;</a>about being there with his “stunning femme fatale wife.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“Anna, I don’t know how to pose in photos but I am lucky to be next to you,” he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">continued</a>. “And you’re the only person I want to make laugh, truly.”</p><h2>Mulaney’s Struggle with Addiction</h2><p>The Netflix stand-up star has always been candid about his past addiction, telling stories of his partying and prescription and illegal drug abuse from a young age to his journey to sobriety. He became <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sober</a> in his early 20s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In a September 2019 interview with Esquire, the comedian&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bared</a>&nbsp;it all as he got candid about his addiction. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> how he started drinking at 13 and hated smoking marijuana but “loved” cocaine and other prescription drugs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I drank for attention. I was really outgoing, and then at 12, I wasn’t. I didn’t know how to act. And then I was drinking, and I was hilarious again.</p><p>Mulaney also shared stories about his dark past in his comedy specials. He noted that he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accidentally</a>&nbsp;got a prostate exam while trying to acquire Xanax from his doctor and drank perfume while “blacked out” at a party. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The comedian became sober at 23 when he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">realized&nbsp;</a>things were getting out of control.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmqS1r3nMrqOappWueri1xZ5knaGmpL%2BksY2hq6ak</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./serena-williams-french-open-fashion-statement-pic-catsuit-ban.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Serena Williams Plays French Open Making Fashion Statement With Outfit Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-why-fans-are-so-upset-about-emma-chamberlains-met-gala-outfit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Thought Emma Chamberlain's &amp;quot;Stolen&amp;quot; Accessory At The Met Gala Was Worn In Poor Taste</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
