The upload included a screenshot of the title card for Van Ness’ Monday, September 25, appearance on Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” podcast.</p><p>Van Ness — <a href=#>who is nonbinary</a> and uses all pronouns — also reposted a video from activist<strong> Alicia Roth Weigel</strong>, whose work he referenced during the interview. “Important message from @xoxy_alicia,” Van Ness wrote.</p><p>“My lovely friend JVN was out here defending intersex people, and it really sucks that they have to be put in that position of having to be an encyclopedia on every marginalized community to fight the misinformation,” Weigel said. “And I appreciate their work that they do to lift us up so much and help clarify things.”</p><p>Weigel noted that Van Ness got some of the facts wrong about Weigel’s experience, but they had a conversation where Van Ness apologized and said he felt “backed into a corner” and was “trying to just spew as much as information” as possible while speaking to Shepard, 48.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jonathan-van-ness-reacts-to-tense-exchange-with-dax-shepard.jpg><p>“I wanted to take a second to share my story in my words with fully accurate information but also to bring up that again, it sucks that someone like JVN is expected to be this, like, savior of all marginalized communities in all instances. And let’s not be out here grilling folks like that all the time,” Weigel said.</p><p>Van Ness appeared on “Armchair Expert” to <a href=#>discuss his own podcast</a>, “Getting Curious,” but the conversation took a turn when Shepard began questioning Van Ness about <a href=#>gender-affirming care</a> for trans youth. “Some people are very uncomfortable about teenagers transitioning,” Shepard said. “How do we know that the person’s not gonna change their mind? Then there’s another counterargument. If they kill themselves, then that’s really f–king permanent. … To even question it makes you an enemy. I don’t think that’s the way forward.”</p><p>Van Ness patiently defended the rights of trans people, but eventually, he admitted that it was “disappointing” to realize that Shepard and others “think they’re really fighting” for women when they exclude trans kids from sports.</p><p>“I’m a nonbinary f–king trans person. When I talk to my dad or people who say similar things, it’s hard to be cool through that,” Van Ness explained. “I’m not calling you a transphobe. You can not be transphobic and still have thoughts that espouse trans misogyny and espouse transphobic ideologies or beliefs and not be transphobic.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Shepard apologized, Van Ness broke down in tears while explaining how much the conversation triggered him. “I could just cry because I’m so tired of having to fight for little kids because they just want to be included,” Van Ness said. “I wish that people were as passionate about little kids being able to be included or grow up as they were about fictitious women’s fairness in sports. I have to tell you I am very tired.”</p><p>Shepard, for his part, has not responded to the backlash surrounding the episode. On Monday, he shared several photos from the podcast taping via <a href=#>Instagram</a> without mentioning the trans rights conversation. “I’ve been a @jvn fan since Gay of Thrones,” Shepard wrote. “Jonathan even convinced me to buy beard oil and green tint moisturizer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp56WwamtzWatmqZdo7K0v4yrnJqbpKh6tbuMrZynq5Visrmvx5qloJ1drLa1tIydmLFlo52ysa3RnWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./judge-judy-is-great-in-bed-says-her-husband-2015154.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Judge Judy Is Great in Bed, Says Her Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-foxworthy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Foxworthy Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
