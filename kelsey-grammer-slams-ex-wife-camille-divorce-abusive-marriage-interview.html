That’s when the Frasier star used his third marriage with Camille, 51 as an example.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“My previous marriage, honestly, I don’t really talk about her [Camille] very much because so much of her life is spent talking about me,” Kelsey explained, adding that he finds Camille’s antics to be “sort of pathetic.” Camille and Kelsey were married from 1997 until 2011 and share two kids — daughter <strong>Mason</strong>, 18, and a 15-year-old son<strong> Jude</strong>. Camille recently celebrated her one-year&nbsp;wedding anniversary&nbsp;with husband&nbsp;<strong>David C. Meyer</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Not going too far into the details, Kelsey said he would “acknowledge one day” in his marriage to Camille, which he noted was the day he knew he would not spend the rest of his life with her. “A month after I had my heart attack, my mother died,” Kelsey recalled. “It’s 12 years ago now. The day of my mother’s funeral, my previous, my third wife basically had an explosion about something and started to tell me, ‘I’m out of this,’ ‘I’m out of here,’ again, ‘I want a divorce,’ which we’d had the same conversation for eight years, and it was tiresome,” he explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kelsey continued, “I realized at that moment that I was done with her… that I was not going to end up in this relationship for much longer and somewhere under a year, I was done.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The actor went on to gush over his fourth and current wife, 38-year-old <strong>Kayte Walsh</strong>, who he married in 2011. “We are two individuals who have become a third identity…which is us together,” Kelsey, who described Kayte as the most mature woman he’s ever been with despite her being the youngest, said of their connection. The couple shares a daughter and two sons together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ye5BsZqSdnKiyunnGq5impZWnerS4wKaqZp2oYsSqssRmmpqlmaG5pnnDoq2oqpOaeqKu1Kygr51doq6zvsianp5lmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lizabts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Liz Abts, Author at Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./byron-buxton-mlb-stats-wife-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Byron Buxton MLB Stats, Wife, Net Worth, Salary, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
