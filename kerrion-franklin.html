He was looking forward to his 33rd birthday in May 2021 as of March 2021.</p><p>Furthermore, Kerrion was born under the sign of Taurus.</p><h2><span id=Kerrion_Franklin-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings>Kerrion Franklin- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings</span></h2><p>Kerrion Franklin was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Kirk Franklin and an unidentified biological mother. While not much needs to be said about Kirk Franklin, he is widely regarded as the greatest gospel singer of all time. Kerrion’s biological mother has remained unnoticed by the media.</p><p>However, a thread started in Lipstick Alley in which a few people mentioned Kerrion’s biological mother actually disowned him because he was gay. Kirk and his ex-partner Kerrion met him when he was a teenager. While both of his parents are to blame for his estrangement, he frequently provoked and started a feud with his father.</p><p>While resentment and disagreements between Kerrion and his father have surfaced, Kerrion’s biological mother has remained silent throughout the ongoing drama between father and son. Kerrion took to Instagram in March 2020 to share,</p><p>“This is the final post before the full interview. For protection, he turns to social media. My grandparents are behind me, and they are furious with my parents right now for how they have treated me the entire time. Keep it sweet, xo Today, no one in my family called me.”</p><p>Kirk later married Tammy Franklin, Kerrion’s stepmother, who treated him as if he were her own son. Tammy had a daughter, Carrington Franklin, whom Kirk later adopted. Carrington Franklin was widely assumed to be Kerrion’s sister, but this does not appear to be the case.</p><p>Kirk and Tammy also had two children, Kennedy Franklin and Caziah Franklin.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also read: Conor Coady, Séamus Coleman, Diego Conde, David Soria"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1061505,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"Arial","16":9,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":22}{"1":24,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":38}{"1":40,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":51}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/conor-coady/"}{"1":22}{"1":24,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/seamus-coleman/"}{"1":38}{"1":40,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/diego-conde/"}{"1":51}{"1":53,"2":"https://sportskicker.com/player/david-soria/"}{"1":64}'>Also read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Conor Coady</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Séamus Coleman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Diego Conde</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>David Soria</a></span></p><h2><span id=Education>Education</span></h2><p>To begin with, Kerrion Franklin attended Santa Monica College after graduating from high school.
