The reality television star was once able to meet the needs of his family and fully reap the benefits of his lifestyle choices, but things started to shift when he started to show obvious favoritism to his last and most recent wife, Robyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans watched as <a href=#>one by one, the women declared their unhappiness with Kody, </a>and were stunned when Meri Brown revealed she and Kody had a non-existent intimate life. Making matters worse was the fact that<a href=#> Christine Brown decided to leave Kody for good</a> and moved Utah, putting her polygamous lifestyle and her marriage to Kody far behind her, with no intentions of looking back.</p><p>With all this turmoil and controversy surrounding Kody's inability to hold his family together, fans are starting to wonder if he will eventually get new wives to sustain his way of life.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-39-s-fresh-start><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kody Brown's Fresh Start</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kody Brown has been honest about considering a fresh, new start for himself. He understands that the polygamous family he worked so hard to cultivate has fallen apart around him, and it's quite obvious that there isn't an easy fix to mend this problem. Starting new with some additional wives seems like it would be a natural solution. This would shift the focus of fans away from his current failures and direct them to the intrigue that a new relationship would bring.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything The 'Sister Wives' Have Said About Robyn Brown And Her Relationship With Kody</a></span></p><h2 id=this-decision-is-in-the-hands-of-the-39-sister-wives-39><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>This Decision Is In The Hands Of The 'Sister Wives'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Kody Brown's decision to bring new wives into the Brown family is going to depend on what his current and remaining wives do next. Kody has always maintained that he won't leave his wives on his own accord and has repeatedly stated if they want to leave, they should be the ones to depart on their own accord.</p><p>The current state of affairs isn't working for anyone, but if Kody suddenly introduces another wife, it may tip his current wives over the edge and encourage them to leave.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-may-have-no-choice><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kody Brown May Have No Choice</span></h2><p>If Kody Brown doesn't find a way to create peace with his existing wives and make them each happy enough to stay, he may soon not have any choice but to take on new wives and embark on a new start. The only wife that seems wiling to happily remain with Kody is Robyn Brown, but if she's the only one that stays, Kody would need to find new wives in order to maintain his status as the head of a polygamous family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-sister-wives-don-39-t-seem-to-need-kody-brown-anymore><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Sister Wives Don't Seem To Need Kody Brown Anymore</span></h2><p>Janelle Brown has recently come forward to state that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she really doesn't need Kody anymore,</a> and this may very well be the opening that Kody fills with another person. Janelle has opened up recently, stating, "I’ve had to really think. My children are almost grown and there’s not a huge necessity anymore to stay. It was a wonderful way to raise children... With Kody and I right now, our relationship is pretty strained. And you know, it’s easy to walk away.”</p><h2 id=robyn-brown-can-be-introduced-as-being-the-favorite><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Robyn Brown Can Be Introduced As Being The Favorite</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of the friction between the Sister Wives has stemmed from the fact that Kody Brown failed to balance his time between them. When Robyn joined the family and Kody proceeded to marry her, it became abundantly clear to the rest of the wives that Robyn held a special place in his heart. Kody has made no secret of the fact that he prefers Robyn over the others, which doesn't bode well to keeping things unified.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sister Wives: Kody Brown's Wives And Kids All Seem To Be Fed Up With Him</a></span></p><p>It would be beneficial to bring in new wives and make it clear in the onset that Robyn is the main wife that exists on her own level. That gives him a fresh start and operates on the assumption that friction wouldn't develop if Robyn's hierarchy is pre-declared.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-told-39-sister-wives-39-they-are-free-to-leave><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kody Brown Told 'Sister Wives' They Are Free To Leave</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kody Brown has boldly told his current wives that they are free to go anytime. When this is paired with his declaration that he would not leave them but would rely on the wives to leave on their own accord, it seems Kody is trying to push them all away. By telling them they are free to leave at a time that things are not going well in his relationships, it may give Kody the opportunity to start new with greater ease.</p><h2 id=starting-fresh-may-be-the-only-way-kody-brown-regains-control><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Starting Fresh May Be The Only Way Kody Brown Regains Control</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kody had control of his life when his wives lived in Vegas with him. </a>The move to Arizona proved to be unbearable for the wives, and he immediately began to lose control over his personal life. The ladies started venting to one another and began discussing Robyn's preferred treatment when compared to the other wives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Issues such as failed intimacy and lack of attention began to rise to the surface, and Kody was exposed. The easy way for him to regain control would be to wipe the slate clean and build new relationships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sister Wives: Christine Brown Is Living Her Best Life Without Kody</a></span></p><h2 id=christine-brown-39-s-absence-leaves-a-gap-in-the-39-sister-wives-39-family><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Christine Brown's Absence Leaves A Gap In The 'Sister Wives' Family</span></h2><p>Now that Christine Brown has officially left Kody and relocated to Utah to start her new life <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there is an obvious gap </a>that can be easily filled with another wife. She has left a space that Kody could put another wife into, and it would only make sense to fill the void, to remove the fixation on the fact that it exists. Christine is very done with Kody and there's no hope of her ever coming back, so there would be nothing stopping Kody from finding a replacement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kody-brown-wants-more-children><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kody Brown Wants More Children</span></h2><p>There's no mistaking the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kody Brown wants to have more children</a>. He has stated that it's important to him to grow and expand his family further, but his current situation isn't lending itself to that experience.</p><p>Of the wives that he has left, Robyn is the only one that remains fond of him, and she has been clear that she's not interested in having more children. She is the only wife young enough to have kids, but she has already had five children and isn't likely to have more. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kody may bring a new wife to the family </a>for the sheer purpose of procreating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-sister-wives-39-must-go-on><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>'Sister Wives' Must Go On</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, if Janelle or Meri decide to leave Kody, there won't be enough content to keep the show on the air. The premise of Sister Wives is to depict the unique lifestyle and challenges facing polygamous relationships, so it's hinged on having several wives in the equation. If Kody wants to maintain his reign as the most famous polygamous family on reality television, he is going to have to engage in relationships with new women. After all, the show must go on.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Is What The Brown Family On ‘Sister Wives’ Really Thinks About Each Other</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiqJypYq%2Bzu9anZKedp2LEqrLEZqqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWTqr%2Bzsc2tZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqKNiv6bCxJqjnpxdmLWztdKtoKedXZe%2FsMPNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yaron-varsano.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yaron Varsano, Husband of Gal Gadot!
