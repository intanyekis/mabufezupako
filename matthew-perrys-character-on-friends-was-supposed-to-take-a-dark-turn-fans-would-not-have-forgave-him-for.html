Friends was the hottest show on television, while Chandler's relationship with Monica was loved by fans. However, there was a pitch made that could have completely changed the dynamic of their relationship and, in fact, a guest star claims she actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rehearsed the fateful scene that got axed</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa Cash was indeed supposed to appear during the episode that saw the cast of Friends in Vegas. She said of the episode, “I was told that [Perry] went to the writers and said the audience will never forgive him for cheating on Monica, which ― he was probably right.</p><p>That would have changed possibly the course of the show, and of his character.”</p><p>Credit to Perry for refusing the storyline. As for Lisa Cash, she still appeared in a lesser role on the show as a flight attendant.</p><p>Despite the nixed storyline, she praised her time alongside Matthew Perry.</p><p>“I was new to the industry, and it could have been really intimidating for me ― like, Season 5 of ‘Friends,’ and a scene with Matthew Perry!” she told TMZ. “But I just felt so comfortable, and he was really likable and welcoming and just made me feel at ease ... It was just really fun doing the scene with him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-19t165219-642.png> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:10</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fans-of-friends-believe-this-actor-played-a-different-character-on-the-show-before-landing-a-recurring-role.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The "Golden Rule" The Cast Of Friends Never Dared To Break Off-Camera, According To Matthew Perry</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The cast of Friends stayed true to a certain rule despite the temptation to break it.</span><p>The moment could have ruined things for lots of fans.

They are so dedicated. We have shown such great respect to them. But there’s a moment where if you push them too far, they’ll never come back. And I think that if you show Jim cheating, they’ll never come back.”</p><p>The actor went on to admit that causing this type of doubt was good for the show on the road to its finale.</p><p>“I feel like that kind of worry was good in terms of the fans’ engagement,” he said. “I needed to worry them that maybe I was going to give them a bad ending so they were happy when they got a good ending.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking back, Krasinski was completely right as such a scene would not have been accepted by many diehard Office fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2Beqauxo2Kwqa3RmpqtnaJivK95xaugnqaUqHq4rdJmqq6ooKTAprCMraZmrJGgsm6tjJ2Yq6NdqcKzuoyfmKerXay8trjDZqWorF2drrexjJ%2Bmq5%2BRq7JutMimZJ%2BnomQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pepper-bak-troy-coxon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pepper Bk Troy Coxon - Net Worth 2018, Bio &amp;amp; Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-how-michael-shannon-became-a-hollywood-star.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's How Michael Shannon Became A Hollywood Star</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
