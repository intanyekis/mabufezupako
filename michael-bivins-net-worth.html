New Edition got split in 1989, but re-united in 1996 until 2004, and in this time span they released seven studio albums, this group paving the way for boy group bands like “Backstreet Boys” and “New Kids on the Block”. Later Michael formed Bell Biv Devoe along with two members of New Edition, and their first studio album “Poison” was a massive hit, which sold more than four million copies and topped the charts.

His band members included <a href=#>Ralph</a>, Bobby, <a href=#>Ricky</a> and <a href=#>Ronnie DeVoe</a>. He stated that they were more interested in enjoying music rather than in making heaps of money, they satisfying their their audiences.
