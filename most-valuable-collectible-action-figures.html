This is another valuable action figure and is available for about $1000.</p><h2 id=jurassic-park-action-figures>Jurassic Park Action Figures</h2><p>Steven Spielberg's concept of coexisting with dinosaurs in a modern world still sends chills down our spines. The idea of a theme park gone wrong resonates with most of us, one of the 90's movie franchises that earned millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The obsession with the action figure of the <a href=#>tyrannosaurus or the T-rex </a>is still relevant. The omega T-rex is one of the original <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90's action figures</a> that has been listed on eBay for about $2800.</p><h2 id=boba-fett-and-jawa-in-vinyl-cape-from-star-wars>Boba Fett and Jawa in Vinyl Cape from Star Wars</h2><p>A Vinyl caped Jawa humanoid action figure featured in Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope is still quite valuable. Made as one of the original pieces from the '90s, one such figure would have a value of about $18000.</p><p>The original Boba Fett figures did not sell very well because they were not exceptionally safe for children to handle with their rocket-firing backpack. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this action figure</a>'s original prototype was auctioned at a New Toy Fair for a massive $150,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=transformers-action-figures-prototypes>Transformers Action Figures Prototypes</h2><p>One of the most popular transformer characters was Soundwave.

These were at first characters in a 1984 comic series, which was later turned into a television show. Some of the original toy figures made back then have a value of nearly $400-900. But rarer models could also be priced at $1000.</p><p>Another character from this franchise, Scratch the Cat, inspired action figure toys. However, since these figures were not as mass-produced as the hero figures, the connoisseurs sought them frantically later, and their value increased. This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1993 toy figure</a> could be priced between $1,200 to $1,600.</p><p>Thus, on looking at the rising value of these old but favorite action figures, one realizes that it is not simply about being a kid's toy.
