The social media star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged the wrongdoing, but she also admitted she learned a lot from it</a>.</p><p>"I think this has been a really eye-opening experience for me," she said. "And although there's a lot of negative around it, and there's a lot of mistakes and wrongdoings, it's led me to have a completely different outlook on a lot of situations."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star added that she isn't trying to defend herself. "There is no justifying or excusing what happened because what happened is wrong." However, Olivia Jade did admit that she wants to move on from the scandal and focus on her future.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Here's How Olivia Jade Picked Herself Up After The College Admissions Scandal">Here's How Olivia Jade Picked Herself Up After The College Admissions Scandal</a></span></p><p>"I'm 21 and I feel like I deserve a second chance to redeem myself to show I've grown," she said. "I'm not trying to victimize myself. I don't want pity. I don't deserve pity. We messed up. I just want a second chance to say I recognize I messed up. For so long, I wasn't able to talk about this because of the legalities behind it. I never got to say I'm sorry that this all happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-olivia-jade-and-her-mother-lori-loughlin-still-close>Are Olivia Jade And Her Mother Lori Loughlin Still Close?</h2><p>While there's no doubt that Olivia was upset when news of the scandal broke, today, she seems to have made peace with it. In fact, the social media star revealed that she even admired her mother during the "frustrating time", adding that Lori Loughlin is the "most incredible mother in the world."</p><p>On her Conversations with Olivia Jade podcast, the 22-year-old revealed that watching her mother go through the legal battle and seeing her get sentenced to prison <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was incredibly difficult</a>.</p><p>"Even though I also was getting dragged negatively, it didn't nearly affect me as much as seeing Mom having all this thrown on her," Olivia Jade said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She really took this whole thing on her back, solely. There are a lot of people that were in this case, and a lot of other parents, and I do not know one other person's name. It caused a lot of anger within me when I would read stuff about her. And I think it's interesting that when I would read stuff about myself … it didn't nearly affect me the same way if I read it about our own mom."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Olivia Jade Ignored Lori Loughlin's Advice About 'Dancing With The Stars'">Olivia Jade Ignored Lori Loughlin's Advice About 'Dancing With The Stars'</a></span></p><p>During her appearance on the Red Table Talk, Olivia Jade also opened up about how close she is to her mother which is why hearing Loughlin admit to the wrongdoings was difficult.</p><p>"They didn’t really have much to say except like, 'I’m so sorry. I really messed up in trying to give the best to you and your sister.' It’s been hard. I think for anybody, no matter what the situation is, you don’t want to see your parents go to prison. But also, I think it’s necessary for us to move on and move forward,” the influencer said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’m super close with my parents, especially my mom, she’s like my best friend, so it’s definitely been really hard not to be able to talk to her, but I know she’s strong and I know it’s a good reflection period."</p><p>A source for People revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Jade and her sister were very stressed about their mother's prison time</a>. "They are beyond worried," the source revealed. "They can't wait to have their mom home in December, though."</p><p>In the fall of 2021, <a href=#>Olivia Jade participated in season 30 of Dancing with the Stars</a>, where she and her partner, Val Chmerkovskiy, ended up finishing in 8th place.</p><p>The social media star admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her mother has been her biggest supporter</a> throughout the competition. "My mom has been a huge support," she said Loughlin. "She's in total mom mode. She's like, 'Make sure you take an Epsom salt bath,' she's trying to get me to take an ice bath. I'm like, 'I don't need an ice bath yet.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Judging from everything that Olivia Jade has said about her mother in recent years, it's clear that the 22-year-old remained close to her mom.
