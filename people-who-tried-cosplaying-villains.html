Cosplay has become a worldwide phenomenon where people get to dress up—and in some cases—roleplay as their favorite characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may look easy on the outside, but it takes vision, money and a whole lot of creativity to pull it off right. However, there’s a fine line between a great and poor cosplay.</p><p>When cosplayers dress up as villains, they can end up being unintentionally scarier than the original version. Whether it’s a lack of effort or lack of awareness, these cosplayers attempted to dress up as popular villains, but fell short of the mark.</p><h2 id=thanos><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Thanos</span></h2><p>With the release of Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;and Avengers: Endgame, Thanos has never been more popular. Even mainstream audiences know who he is. So if someone decides to dress up like Marvel’s Mad Titan, they better do it right.</p><p>Unfortunately for this costume, despite staying true to Thanos’ look from the comics, flopped.</p><h2 id=catwoman><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Catwoman</span></h2><p>This cosplayer looks one second away from saying, “Meow” in a sincere voice. One would think that after the Halle Berry Catwoman&nbsp;movie, no one would want to dress up as that character anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This cosplayer was no scaredy-cat though and went all in on portraying everyone's favorite antiheroine from Gotham City.</p><h2 id=jabba-the-hutt><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Jabba The Hutt</span></h2><p>If the man dressed up as Princess Leia wasn’t present, it’d be hard to peg what villain is beside him. At first glance, it looks like a blow-up pool toy. It also resembles those inflatable dinosaur costumes.</p><p>Thanks to Leia though, we’re all led to believe that this is, in fact, Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars.</p><h2 id=juggernaut><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Juggernaut</span></h2><p>Juggernaut is a villain from X-Men&nbsp;whose powers are straightforward enough. He’s enormous, wears a metal suit and helmet and literally runs his head into things.</p><p>Hopefully, this cosplayer didn’t roleplay the character or try to run into any walls. The costume’s materials don’t look like they could hold up to that.</p><h2 id=voldemort><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Voldemort</span></h2><p>If not for the heading, many might find it hard to discern who exactly this villain is. It is, in fact, Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A bald cap, tape over the eyebrows and a black trash bag is all this cosplayer needed to make their costume.</p><h2 id=jessie><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Jessie</span></h2><p>Embodying one half of Team Rocket from the animated Pokémon&nbsp;show is this Jessie wannabe.</p><p>While they made sure to have all the details in the show, from the purple hair to the green earrings to the black gloves and boots, the end result adds up to a failed cosplay.</p><h2 id=darth-vader><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Darth Vader</span></h2><p>As one of the biggest franchises ever, Star Wars&nbsp;characters have been a go-to cosplay for decades. This photo has Yoda, Princess Leia and even a blue trash can that’s supposed to be R2-D2.</p><p>Yet looming in the background, in what looks like a black ninja mask, is Darth Vader—though the black button-up shirt begs to differ.</p><h2 id=dr-robotnik><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Dr. Robotnik</span></h2><p>With Jim Carrey tapped to play the role of Dr. Robotnik in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;movie, one can expect this video game villain to have a resurgence in cosplay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This unenthusiastic cosplayer even brought a chaos emerald and a ring with him, which he holds in each hand; though even that wasn't enough to salvage this costume.</p><h2 id=frieza><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Frieza</span></h2><p>Fans of the show Dragonball Z&nbsp;will immediately recognize this iconic villain, Frieza. Although the design and colors of the suit look accurate, it’s the actual materials that don’t quite look right.</p><p>There are even some added traits the character never had, like Frieza's wrinkly neck. He even has his fists clenched the way the character would when he’s powering up.</p><h2 id=venom><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Venom</span></h2><p>Venom has always been a cult favorite among Spider-man&nbsp;fans. With the recent live-action film only adding to the fandom, appreciation for the symbiote is even bigger now.</p><p>There’s no denying this cosplayer went all out with a full body suit that has lots of details. Perhaps Venom is one of those cosplays that’s just too hard to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joker-and-bane><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Joker and Bane</span></h2><p>These cosplayers come close but fall short of reaching great costumes. The Joker put a lot of effort into his face makeup, however, the rest of the costume is lacking.</p><p>Then there’s Bane, which captures key pieces of the character’s costume, though they could’ve added some of the smaller accents like a belt and storage tanks on his back.</p><h2 id=piccolo><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Piccolo</span></h2><p>As a caveat, Piccolo is a good guy, but he started out as a villain in the original Dragonball&nbsp;series. It looks as if the cosplayer used toilet paper to make the character's signature turban and markers to draw on his alien arms.</p><p>Let’s not forget the glasses either, which Piccolo never wore.</p><h2 id=mojo-jojo><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mojo Jojo</span></h2><p>When there isn’t clothing available to make a costume, make it out of balloons. That was the idea behind this Powerpuff Girls enemy, Mojo Jojo. While the balloon work is impressive enough, as a cosplay, it’s strange and proportionally off.</p><p>The face alone is enough to raise eyebrows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=darth-vader-hairdo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Darth Vader Hairdo</span></h2><p>This is cosplay at its lowest. Appropriately dubbed “low-cost cosplay,” all it requires is long black hair and sunglasses to pull of this Darth Vader. It just isn’t a great cosplay.</p><p>While this guy’s hair manages to capture the same shape of Vader’s iconic helmet, it wouldn’t get recognized in public.</p><h2 id=bowser><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bowser</span></h2><p>Bowser is a tough cosplay to nail down. The dinosaur turtle has been terrorizing Mario in video games for years. Now he’s terrorizing us through cosplays like this one.</p><p>While the cosplayer sports the characteristic tail, horns, and haircut associated with the villain, it's not going to win any awards.</p><h2 id=queen-of-hearts><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Queen of Hearts</span></h2><p>These three decided to take on characters made famous in Disney’s Alice in Wonderland. In the center is the Queen of Hearts, the story’s villain, while Tweedledee and Tweedledum are standing on both sides.</p><p>Though when someone incorporates what looks like a Burger King crown in their costume, they might have to rethink their cosplay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joker-and-harley-quinn><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Joker And Harley Quinn</span></h2><p>It’s not unusual anymore to see themed weddings. This one took inspiration from the characters Joker and Harley Quinn from the Batman universe, who have a love-hate relationship.</p><p>If these two actually did tie the knot, one would think they would have put more thought into the cosplay-side of their outfits.</p><h2 id=him><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>HIM</span></h2><p>One of the more bizarre villains from The Powerpuff Girls&nbsp;was HIM, a theatrical and devilish villain. Not only did this cosplayer dress up like HIM, but even evoked some of his mannerisms.</p><p>While the cosplay isn’t lacking in effort, considering he had to paint himself red, it ultimately falls flat.</p><h2 id=majin-buu><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Majin Buu</span></h2><p>There’s something endearing about cosplays made out of things people find lying around their house. That doesn’t mean they’re all good costumes though.</p><p>This re-creation of the villain Majin Buu in his final form from Dragonball Z&nbsp;may have found a creative use for a footstool, but its power level isn’t even 9000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mooglie><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mooglie</span></h2><p>Someone must have asked, "Who you gonna cosplay?" To which this person came up with the ghost, Mooglie, from the Ghostbusters icon.</p><p>He even included the red crossed out symbol. While it might be a stretch to call Mooglie a villain, it’s an unusual cosplay that won’t impress at any conventions.</p><p>Sources - Reddit & Twitter</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnqegobJuw8eoZK2qmZqxbq%2FOrKelmameu6h51aKjpZmZo8Bw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./autopsy-of-brissa-romero-in-vernon-hills-pond.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Autopsy of Brissa Romero in Vernon Hills pond: Brissa Romeros lifeless body Autopsy was discovere</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./warren-g-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Warren G Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
