イケメン担当の北川さんと違って、ミュージシャンとしての話題が多く私生活は謎に包まれています。
岩沢厚治さんは長く交際している彼女がいながらも、ゆずがブレイクした後も独身を貫きました。
しかし、2011年に長く交際していた彼女と遂に結婚を発表しました！
当時は、岩沢厚治さんは彼女がいながらも都合良い生活をして女遊びをしてるのではないか？と噂されましたが、しっかりと入籍したことで、ファンの信頼を獲得しました。
今日は岩沢厚治さんの現在の嫁との出会いと結婚までのエピソードと、噂される子供の誕生について調べてみたいと思います。
岩沢厚治は2011年に一般人の彼女と結婚。嫁との出会いは路上ライブで12年交際 岩沢厚治さんは「ゆず」にて歌唱力やミュージシャンとしてのポテンシャルの高さが認められ、若い頃から”天才”だと評されていました。
2000年代に日本を代表するミュージシャンの仲間入りを果たしましたが、岩沢厚治さんも北川悠仁さんも独身を貫きました。
しかし、2011年に売れない時代から交際していた一般人の彼女と結婚したことを発表しました。
フォークデュオ「ゆず」の岩沢厚治（３４）が明日２５日、出身地の横浜市内で結婚披露パーティーを開くことが２３日、分かった。相手は同年代の一般女性で、互いに１０代からの交際を貫いた純愛婚になる。新婦は同市在住で、岩沢は忙しいスケジュールの中、月に数回のペースで友人らを交えて会食をしながら交際を続けてきたという。パーティーは飲食店を借り切って開かれ、口数の少ない岩沢が歌で愛の言葉を披露するかもしれない。引用元：Yahoo!ニュース
当時は３１１で、日本全体で命の重たさや家族の存在の大きさを感じ、入籍するカップルが多かった時期。
相方の北川悠仁さんも結婚したということで、2011年の結婚ブームのど真ん中に、ゆずのお二人の結婚のインパクトがあります。
岩沢厚治さんが結婚した彼女は12年も交際した相手であり、ファンも世間も暖かく祝福しました。
岩沢厚治と現在の嫁の馴れ初めは路上ライブ 岩沢厚治さんと現在の嫁の馴れ初めは、かなり運命的です。
ゆずといえば、ふたりの地元・横浜を中心に路上ライブを行い、気づけば路上に数千人を集めるほどの人気があった
嫁との馴れ初めはその伝説の「路上ライブ」です。
妻は元々は彼のライブに集まったお客さんのひとりで、普通にファンだったようです。
ゆずが少しずつ大きくなり、ライブハウスで演奏するまでの過程を、側で見守った女性なのです。
彼女がライブに足を運ぶにつれ仲良くなり、打ち上げなどで、当時は居酒屋で一緒に飲むことも多かったそうです。
当時から2人は周囲から「お似合いのカップル」と言われていたようで、かなりラブラブだったみたいです。
忙しくなった後もも友人を交えて食事するなどして、純愛を貫いてのゴールとなりました。
岩沢厚治と嫁の間に子供が誕生？極秘で娘が生まれてる説 岩沢厚治さんは現在の嫁さんと2011年に結婚しました。
結婚した当初の報道では、嫁さんが妊ってるようなニュースはありませんでした。
あれから10年以上の月日が流れていますが、岩沢厚治さんに子供が誕生したようなニュースは一向にありません。
相方の北川さんは高島彩さんと結婚し、すでに２人の子宝に恵まれてますが、こちらは著名人同士ということで、公表も堂々としてます。
一方の岩沢厚治さんは、一部は極秘で出産しているとの噂もあります。
ネットでは「けいゆう病院で生まれた」という情報があります。
けいゆう病院は横浜市内にある総合病院で、産婦人科もあります。
噂では子供は女の子（娘）で、今後も公表することはないとか。
岩沢さん本人が子供に関して言及したことは一度もないので、全て非公式のソースです。
過去に甲本ヒロトさんが、子供を非公表にしていたものの、自分の発言から発覚してしまうというパターンがありました。
もし、岩沢さんに子供がいるのであれば、どこかでポロッと話してしまうかもしれません。
岩沢厚治の結婚式。赤れんがのパーティと指輪 2011年に結婚したことを発表した岩沢厚治さん。
岩沢厚治は結婚式の披露宴を横浜にある赤レンガ倉庫で行い、それは大きなニュースになりました。
岩沢さんが憧れている長渕剛さんも登場するなど、かなり派手なパーティだったみたいです。
音楽仲間など100人ほど集まったそうです。
派手に放送された披露宴ですが、実は極秘にしていたようで、所属のレコード会社にも伝えていなかったそうです。
レコード会社は知らなかったとのことですが、岩沢さんは、
事後報告とゆうカタチになってしまいましたが、間違った情報の錯綜や混乱を避ける為に、敢えてそうさせて頂いた事をご理解願えればと思います。
と答えていました。
岩沢厚治は結婚して以降いつも左手薬指に結婚指輪 岩沢厚治さんは結婚して以降、いつも左手薬指に結婚指輪をしています。
なんと、ライブなどでギターを演奏をするときも外さないのです！
岩沢さんの嫁好きぶりが伺える行動です！
非常に嫁想いなことから、ファンからも結婚指輪を外さないことに対して称賛の声が多く挙がっています。
多くのミュージシャンがファンに気を遣って外したりしますが、そこはゆずのファン層の良さが出てるからできることですね！
岩沢厚治の嫁の名前はひとよ？なおこ？自宅は横浜 岩沢さんの嫁さんは一般人ということで名前は公表していません。
ただ、同年代で、10代の頃に路上ライブで知り合い、その後に12年の交際を経て結婚したということしか情報はありません。
ちなみに結婚式なども横浜でしたが、結婚後の自宅の場所も横浜にあるとされてます。
相方の北川悠仁さんも、高島彩さんと横浜で結婚生活を送っていますね！
二人共、地元をガチで愛してることがわかります。
地元が近いということで、二人の家族で遊ぶ機会もありそうです！
ちなみに、現在も横浜アリーナでのライブがゆずにとって特別なのも、昔からの友達が多く駆けつけてくれるからだそうです。
地元密着型で、その気持ちがずっと変わらないなんて素敵な話ですね！
