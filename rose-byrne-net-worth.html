She is best known for her leading role in the movie “The Goddess of 1967” and her appearance in the television series “Damages”. Born on 24 July 1979, she is of Irish and Scottish descent. One of the famous actresses in Hollywood, Rose has been active in her profession since 1994.</p><p>A prominent name in both the television and movie industries, one may wonder how rich is Rose Byrne at the present? As estimated by sources, Rose counts her net worth at the amount of $12.5 million as of early 2016. Needless to say, the major part of her income is her activity in the film industry as an actress. Her being a part of Australian as well as the American film industry has definitely paid her well to make her a multi-millionaire on this day.</p><h3>Rose Byrne Net Worth $12.5 Million</h3><p>Raised in the suburbs of Sydney, Byrne attended Balmain Public School and matriculated from Hunters Hill High School. Later, she attended Bradfield College before joining the University of Sydney. Rose was interested in acting from her childhood which is why she began taking acting classes in the Australian Theatre for Young People at the age of eight. When she was twenty years old, she again studied acting at the Atlantic Theatre Company.</p><p>Rose initiated her career in acting at the age of thirteen, when she was cast in the film “Dallas Doll”. She became more and more prominent as an actress in Australia as she performed in television shows and series like “Heartbreak High” and “Echo Point”. She also acted in the Australian movies “Two Hands”, “Heath Ledger” and “The Goddess of 1967” among others, before dipping her toes in American television and finally Hollywood.</p><p>During her career, Rose has performed in several successful Hollywood movies, including “Bridesmaids”, “Insidious”, “The Turning”, “Neighbors”, “Spy”, “Troy”, “X-Men: First Class” and several more. She has also earned fame as an American television actress, as she was a leading character in the series “Damages”. Being a part of all these movies and television shows has obviously been significant in adding to Rose’s net worth over the years.</p><p>Given her contributions towards the film industry, Rose Byrne has been rewarded many a time with prestigious awards. She has been nominated twice for Golden Globes awards and Two Emmy awards and has won a Venice Film Festival award for her role in the movie “The Goddess of 1967”. She has also shown prominence in theatre and music videos during her career.</p><p>Talking about her personal life, the 36 years old actress is now a mother of a child whom she shares with her partner <a href=#>Bobby Cannavale</a> – they have been together since 1994 and currently reside in Manhattan, New York City. For now, Rose enjoys her career as one of the acclaimed Hollywood actresses while her present net worth of $12.5 million caters to her daily lifestyle.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=26.705882352941><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rose Byrne</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 24, 1979</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Balmain, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.68&nbsp;m, 1.68&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>University of Sydney, Hunters Hill High School, Australian Theatre for Young People, Bradfield College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Australian</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Rocco Cannavale, Rocco Cannavale</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Robin Byrne, Jane Byrne</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Siblings</td><td>Alice Byrne, Lucy Byrne, George Byrne, Alice Byrne, Lucy Byrne, George Byrne</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Partner</td><td>Brendan Cowell (2003 - 2010)</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0126284</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Venice Film Festival award</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Golden Globes awards, Emmy awards</td></tr><tr readability=22><td>Movies</td><td>Neighbors, Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, Spy, Bridesmaids, X-Men: Apocalypse, X-Men: First Class, Troy, Get Him to the Greek, The Meddler, I Give It a Year, Annie, The Internship, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Adult Beginners, 28 Weeks Later, Wicker Park, This Is Where I Leave You,...</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Heartbreak High, Echo Point</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Auburn Hair</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Brown Eyes</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td><a href=#>Annie</a> (2014)</td><td>$500 000</td></tr><tr><td><a href=#>Damages</a> (2007)</td><td>$75,000 /episode</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=77.4039950235><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>[on her movie Annie being panned by critics] I still stand by Annie, you know. It's a film with a great role model for young kids from all walks of life, who are able to see Annie and see someone who looks like themselves. Like everything, it's not for everyone.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2</td><td>[on director Paul Feig] He loves women to be funny and cool, to be smarter than the guys, and to kick ass. He's so interested in breaking all of those gender conventions, and it's really refreshing.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>Bobby (Cannavale) is a great cook. He's Cuban and he does a couple of really good Cuban dishes like arroz con pollo and Cuban cocktails. He's better than I am. Whereas I'm the good cleaner after!</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>4</td><td>There's always going to be backlash and vitriol and haters. But that's just the Internet. You don't really read much positive stuff. It's really just for people to vent. It's just noise.</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>5</td><td>[on people being surprised of the success of Bridesmaids] I was probably very naive. I hadn't done that much comedy, and I honestly didn't realize we were somehow breaking new ground. It was a little disappointing. I'm sure the guys from The Hangover didn't get asked, 'Hey guys, how about this group of men who are all really funny - isn't that amazing?' It gets boring. You wish it wasn't even part of the conversation.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>6</td><td>[on switching from dramatic to comedic roles] It was a very conscious decision. I'm Australian - we don't take ourselves too seriously - but I really didn't know if I would have any luck. Just because you're funny in real life doesn't mean you are necessarily a funny actor; and if you're funny on screen it does not mean you're bound to be funny in real life.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>7</td><td>Do everything, try everything. All work is noble, and each job is a valid experience.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>8</td><td>Films are like a house of cards. You think about doing something and so you sow those seeds. But it can take a long time to grow. You have to look at the bigger picture, because it's an ever-changing landscape.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>9</td><td>I was very, very shy when I was little. Acting lets you access all those different parts of yourself to make the character authentic.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>10</td><td>Australia is my emotional home, but New York is my second home. I feel like myself in the city, and that's all you want from a place. It's an achievement to have found that. But we Australians are wandering people, aren't we?</td></tr><tr readability=6.7372013651877><td>11</td><td>[on working with <a href=#>Glenn Close</a>] We're great friends, and we have a lot of fun together. She's terrific and so smart with the dialogue, my favorite scenes are always the ones between us. She's not a mentor - she's a friend, a colleague and an ally. She doesn't treat me like Patty treats Ellen!</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>12</td><td>I've already started saying that I'm 30 when I'm still 29. That way, I'm already there.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>13</td><td>[on New York City] I'm in love with the city. You can impress an Australian with a city, but you can't impress them with a beach.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>14</td><td>They think I'm depressed because I look serious in photos. It's usually because I'm just nervous. But I've stopped dressing for other people. If I think I look good, that's the most important thing.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>15</td><td>[on acting] I tend to spiral out of control if I'm not working. I get panicked and don't know what to do with myself.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>16</td><td>I think all this insecurity is partly because as an actor you are told when you can practice your craft. The majority of actors - unless you start your own theatre company - are at the beck and call of other people. They're told when they can do their art, whereas painters can paint, writers can write, musicians can play. But actors are always the subject of other people's scrutiny and opinion. I think it breeds more insecurity the more you work because you get rejected on a daily basis, purely for who you are, and not just on a physical basis but also for your personality or origin. My heart breaks every time I don't get a part.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>17</td><td>[Asked about What what she wants for her career] - I just want to continue being able to get roles that scare me and make me better and I think I can only grow as an artist if I do things that are scaring me and making me uncomfortable because that's the only place you'll learn anything.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>18</td><td>I'd say I'm a bit of a fatalist but not as much as I was. I used to be like "whatever happens happens" and have that innate fatalistic outlook. But I think it's more about what you are thinking in your own mind that is the most powerful aspect of controlling your own life.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>19</td><td>I see myself more as a character actress than a celebrity.</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>20</td><td>I think a movie can inspire change, absolutely. Art, a book, a painting, a song, can definitely inspire change, whether it's a small change or a big change but you know there's novels I've read or a scene in a film that I've seen where I definitely inspired something and made a change or addressed an issue in my life or done something cliché like make a phone call. Absolutely, that's the power of art you would call it because it inspires movement within yourself. You know it's only really powerful when it reflects on you and you can relate to it or are moved by it in some way.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>21</td><td>Here in L.A. the standard of beauty is kind of ridiculous. I want to be doing this when I'm in my fifties and sixties and this isn't what I'm going to look like.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>22</td><td>I've had some pretty good experiences on everything, even if the film doesn't always work.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>23</td><td>I'm probably in that next group of actors they call if Scarlett (Johansson) or Keira (Knightley) turns down a part. But I feel really lucky. To be a working actor is pretty incredible, because 99 per cent of actors are out of work. I know a lot of talented people who are better actors than me but haven't had a break. It's all down to timing and luck."</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>24</td><td>I'm starting to know how the world works a bit, and I'm learning more and more that the only thing that matters is what happens between 'action' and 'cut'. I'm allowing myself to be a bit more selfish, for want of a better word, just that it's OK to focus and that I don't have to be nice to everybody."</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>25</td><td>I guess you can get to a level where you choose. I guess when you reach that point maybe you start making decisions about whether you want to be a leading man or woman. I'm not at that point at all. Where I am now, you're very much at everybody else's mercy. You have no control over your career in a lot of ways. It's just important to know what your own goals are, because that's empowering."</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>26</td><td>''I used to drive, pretty pathetically, I'd just drive by their house all the time and they didn't know who I was. I'd just drive by the house all the time. I once knocked on the window and I thought, "What am I doing? What am I going to say if they come to the door and don't know who I am?" On her most dreadful crush.</td></tr><tr readability=2.61><td>27</td><td>I did audition for <a href=#>Home and Away</a> (1988), but they never called me back. I feel I escaped in a way.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>28</td><td>I think its important to keep an element of fear about yourself because it makes you appreciate the jobs.</td></tr><tr readability=2.3142857142857><td>29</td><td>That was easy, I just stood by <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> looking very serious. - On her role in <a href=#>Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</a> (2002).</td></tr><tr readability=6.55><td>30</td><td>I don't take it seriously.
