The original was released more than 20 years ago and starred NBA legend <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a> alongside Bugs Bunny and the cast of Looney Tunes.</p><p>The '90s classic is getting a sequel, however, and it is scheduled to hit theaters during the summer of 2021. Providing its release isn't delayed by the ongoing pandemic, of course. <a href=#>Space Jam: A New Legacy</a> will star modern-day NBA player <a href=#>LeBron James</a>, and according to an early leak, will feature a smorgasbord of characters from the wider <a href=#>Warner Bros.</a> universe.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>LeBron James Gives Fans A First Look At His Tune Squad Uniform For Space Jam 2</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A short synopsis describing what will happen in the movie appears to have confirmed that Space Jam 2 will feature more fictional characters than Looney Tunes alone. Final Space writer Ben Mekler posted the synopsis on Twitter claiming to have received it via a test screening email. The tweet can be found below in which the synopsis for the movie is featured in full. Don't worry, it won't spoil it for you.</p><p>"NBA Superstar LeBron James and his son accidentally get trapped within a world that contains all of Warner Bros.' stories and characters, under the control of a malfunctioning, all-powerful force named Al G," it reads. James, Bugs Bunny, and other Looney Tunes then have to defeat "digital gamified super-versions" of NBA and WNBA stars in order to win back the basketball star's son after he gets kidnapped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similar to the first Space Jam, anyone going to see A New Legacy expecting a serious two hours of in-depth cinema will leave disappointed. If you're after a star-studded blockbuster that will likely be as strange as it is action-packed, this will almost definitely be it. Another mid-90s movie Jumanji was completely revamped for modern-day audiences and did pretty well, even getting a sequel. Fingers crossed we'll be saying the same about Space Jam this time next year.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ant-Man 3's New Villain Could Change The Face Of The MCU</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9KpmJydXZ%2BurnnNnq5mpJWcrqTFjKywp6egqLa0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./291080-what-does-todd-chrisley-do-a-living-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Does Todd Chrisley Do for a Living?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./seargeoh-stallone-actor-wikipedia-bio-age-height-weight-death-cause-funeral-wife-net-worth-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Seargeoh Stallone (Actor) Wikipedia, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Death Cause, Funeral, Wife, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
