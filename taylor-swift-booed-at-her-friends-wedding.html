Clearly, Swift wanted all the attention to be on her close friend during the a special day. Therefore, she did her best to avoid any type of distractions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, that all changed when fans caught wind of Swift at the church after it was leaked on social media.

It was only a 10-foot walk from the church door to the waiting SUV, but Taylor didn't want to play ball, and the fans went from "We love you Taylor" to a chorus of boos, with some chanting "Very disappointing, not cool."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Neil Young Predicted Taylor Swift's Success Years Ago</a></span></p><p>Although Swift was booed for the moment, we really can't blame her for not acknowledging the fans in this particular situation.

Is it going to help my day? Is it important for my life? If the answer is no, then I just don't click. I'm careful about getting sucked into the rabbit hole that is the Internet because, as a songwriter, I don't have the option of having thick skin. As a writer you have to be open to everything, and that includes pain, rejection, self-doubt, fear. I deal with that enough on my own. If you look hard enough, you could find somebody on the Internet criticizing every single thing about you. If you're me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift would also discuss the common criticism she faces writing about her past relationships in songs. Once again, Swift doesn't read into the drama.</p><p>"For a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated—a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way—that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist."</p><p>Despite the ups and downs, Swift has been able to deal with all the drama in the best way possible. She's currently regarded among the top artists in the world, if not, the very best. Her net worth has hit the $1 billion mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkqS8prCMmqtmoJWneqe%2ByJ6lnatdrLKlsMinnmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-jennifer-anistons-father-john-aniston-today-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where is Jennifer Anistons father John Aniston today?
