It’s about how people often have to deal with feelings of inadequacy, and how they try to overcome those feelings in different ways. Doug Smith chose hockey as his way to do that, even though he wasn’t a skilled player.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Importance_of_Enforcers_in_Hockey></span>The Importance of Enforcers in Hockey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Enforcers, like Doug Smith, played a crucial role in the game of hockey. They were the ones who protected their skilled teammates from getting hit or hurt, while also intimidating the opposing team. In a way, they were the enforcers of justice on the ice.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Evolution_of_Enforcers_in_Hockey></span>The Evolution of Enforcers in Hockey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In recent years, the role of enforcers in hockey has diminished due to a growing concern over player safety. The NHL has been cracking down on fighting and hits to the head, which has led to a decrease in the number of enforcers in the league. While some fans argue that hockey is losing its toughness, others believe that it’s becoming a safer and more skill-based sport.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Warren_Zevons_Legacy></span>Warren Zevon’s Legacy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Warren Zevon passed away in 2003, but his legacy as a singer-songwriter continues to live on. His music was known for its dark humor, literary references, and unique storytelling. Songs like “Werewolves of London”, “Lawyers, Guns and Money”, and “Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner” are still popular today.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Impact_of_%E2%80%9CHit_Somebody%E2%80%9D></span>The Impact of “Hit Somebody!”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Hit Somebody!” had a significant impact on the way people viewed enforcers in hockey. Some fans and players saw it as a tribute to their tough, hard-working heroes, while others saw it as a commentary on the violence in the game. Either way, the song sparked a conversation about the role of enforcers in hockey and their place in the sport.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_of_%E2%80%9CHit_Somebody%E2%80%9D_to_Hockey_Fans></span>The Meaning of “Hit Somebody!” to Hockey Fans<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>To hockey fans, “Hit Somebody!” represents the gritty, tough, and often brutal nature of the game. The enforcers on the ice are the ones who defend their teammates from cheap shots and keep opposing players in line. The song is a tribute to their bravery and sacrifice.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Meaning_of_%E2%80%9CHit_Somebody%E2%80%9D_to_Non-Hockey_Fans></span>The Meaning of “Hit Somebody!” to Non-Hockey Fans<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>To non-hockey fans, “Hit Somebody!” may seem like just another sports song. However, the deeper message behind it is one that everyone can relate to. It’s about finding your place in the world, even if it means doing something you’re not particularly good at. It’s about taking risks, standing up for what you believe in, and never giving up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_an_Enforcer_in_Hockey></span>What is an Enforcer in Hockey?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An enforcer in hockey is a player whose role is to protect their teammates and intimidate the opposing team through physical play. While enforcers are often not skilled players, they are capable of delivering big hits and engaging in fights on the ice.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Fighting_Allowed_in_Hockey></span>Is Fighting Allowed in Hockey?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fighting is technically not allowed in hockey, but it is still a part of the game. Players who engage in fights are penalized and can be ejected from the game, but it is still seen as a way to police the game and defend one’s teammates.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Are_Enforcers_in_Hockey_Becoming_Less_Common></span>Why Are Enforcers in Hockey Becoming Less Common?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Enforcers in hockey are becoming less common due to a growing concern over player safety. The NHL has been cracking down on hits to the head and fighting, which has led to a decrease in the number of enforcers in the league. Some fans argue that hockey is losing its toughness, while others say it’s becoming a safer and more skill-based sport.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_%E2%80%9CHit_Somebody%E2%80%9D_Just_an_Ode_to_Violence></span>Is “Hit Somebody!” Just an Ode to Violence?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Hit Somebody!” is not just an ode to violence, but a tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of enforcers in hockey. While violence is a part of the game, the song is about much more than just that. It’s about finding your place in the world, standing up for what you believe in, and never giving up.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Is_Warren_Zevons_Music_So_Iconic></span>Why Is Warren Zevon’s Music So Iconic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Warren Zevon’s music was iconic because of his unique storytelling style, dark humor, and literary references. He wrote about complex characters and situations, making his songs resonate with listeners in a way that few other artists could. His music has stood the test of time and continues to be popular today.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_%E2%80%9CHit_Somebody%E2%80%9D_Still_Relevant></span>Is “Hit Somebody!” Still Relevant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Hit Somebody!” is still relevant today, even though the role of enforcers in hockey has diminished. The message behind the song is one that everyone can relate to – finding your place in the world, taking risks, and standing up for what you believe in. It’s a tribute to the brave souls who put everything on the line, even if they’re not the most skilled at what they do.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_the_Legacy_of_Warren_Zevon></span>What Is the Legacy of Warren Zevon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The legacy of Warren Zevon is one of a talented singer-songwriter who wrote some of the most iconic songs of his generation.
