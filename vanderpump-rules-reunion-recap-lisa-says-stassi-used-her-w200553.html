After last week’s part 1 was mostly centered on <b>Kristen Doute</b> and <b>James Kennedy</b>, this time Brittany and Stassi got a chance to chime in on their own dramatic stories.</span></p><p><b>Brittany Stands by Her Man</b></p><p>Brittany has been on Jax’s side throughout all of season 4. Going into the show, she had no idea who anyone was, including Jax, except for Lisa from <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</i> Brittany said the other women told her about Jax’s reputation of being a womanizer, but she decided to leave “everything” and move in with him anyway.</p><p><span>“When I first met him, we just clicked from the very beginning,” Brittany said. Everyone on the show talked about how nice Brittany is, as even Lisa said,&nbsp;</span><span>“She just seems too sweet for him.” <b>Scheana Shay</b> said she was glad Brittany stuck by Jax because “now we have such an amazing new friend.”</span></p><p><b>Jax Explained Swiping the Shades</b></p><p>“I wanted to be there for him, but I knew he had a lot of growing to do as soon as that happened,” Brittany said about the shoplifting incident.&nbsp;</p><p>Jax also mentioned he had been to jail five times in his lifetime, and Brittany said if she had known that beforehand, she doesn’t know if she would have moved in with him. Jax said he realizes he’s not perfect and has a tendency to do “stupid s–t,” but he called Brittany his rock. He also said that despite his previous aversion to marriage, he is opening up to it because he loves Brittany so much.</p><p><span>“Maybe he can steal her a wedding ring,” <b>Tom Sandoval </b>said. And hey, that isn’t exactly too far-fetched of an idea.</span></p><p><b>Tom and Katie Discuss Their Engagement&nbsp;</b></p><p>“I really, truly wanted Katie to abandon all hope,” <b>Tom Schwartz</b> said about his unusual but romantic way of proposing to <b>Katie Maloney</b>. She admitted she was wearing thin before the proposal and didn’t know how much longer she could go without a ring. Even so, she didn’t want to be proposed to with a “cliché, Hallmark kind of thing,” so she was satisfied with the way Tom did it.</p><p>However, they didn’t exactly rush to consummate their engagement, with Schwartz admitting that they didn’t have sex until about two and a half weeks after the proposal.</p><p>“We technically should have had sex that night, but I went to put taquitos in the oven, and [Katie] passed out after I got back,” he said.</p><p>Schwartz said their relationship is inspired a lot by Scheana and <b>Michael Shay</b>’s relationship. Scheana and Shay started out rocky but made it through, and Schwartz feels the same about his own romance.</p><p>“It kind of sucked in the beginning, and now I feel like it’s amazing, and it keeps getting better and better,” Schwartz said. The couple’s upcoming wedding episode is sure to be incredible and undoubtedly dramatic.</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>Ariana Confronts Scheana Over Text-Gate</b></p><p><b>Ariana Madix</b> and Scheana have had a rocky year. “We just kind of figured out a new way to be,” Ariana said about their new friendship dynamic. Ariana brought up the time when Scheana bashed Tom Sandoval to Ariana’s mother through text while they were in Hawaii. At one point, Ariana even brought out her phone to read the texts out loud. She was angry because Scheana unnecessarily concerned her mom about her relationship with her boyfriend when it was fine.</p><p>Even <b>Lala Kent </b>got involved and said, “If someone did that to me and my mom, I best believe someone would be going down, and it would be you.”</p><p>Katie said she feels like Ariana thinks she’s too good for everyone, adding that Ariana is a “Debbie downer.” Ariana fired back that the group just takes her comments the wrong way.</p><p>“This is the most toxic environment I’ve ever witnessed in my life,” the Sur hostess said about the group as a whole. She’s not exactly wrong, but it does make for entertaining TV.</p><p><b>Lala Defends Flaunting What She’s Got</b></p><p>When Andy brought up the incident in Hawaii where Lala flashed her boobs in front of all of the couples on the trip, Katie got a bit angry. Even though she said she’s “not offended by boobs,” Katie admitted she is offended by Lala’s behavior. Katie said she believes Lala is a liar and thinks that’s why she can’t make any friends. Lala thought that Katie had it out for her in the beginning and never wanted to give her a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Lala told Katie to stop cutting her off when she was speaking, to which Katie responded, “You know about wrapping people up and cutting them off, don’t you, Lala?”</p><p>Lala and Jax have a history of “innocent” flirting, but it did cause a problem in Jax and Brittany’s relationship. Jax lied to Lala about Brittany coming into town to try to get her to go out with him, and Brittany was not happy when she saw the episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanderpump-174102e7-71a5-4c9e-8b25-866110ac8f2b.jpg><p>“I was moving and changing my entire life for this man, and I just wanted to know what was actually going on,” Brittany said.</p><p>Jax also denied saying certain flirtatious things to Lala when she confronted him, and Lala just wanted him to own up to it because she owned up to flirting back. However, they both agreed that if they wanted to hook up, it would have already happened. Indeed, they both have a history of pursuing a lot of people sexually, so that statement is probably very true.</p><p><b>Stassi Tries to Explain Herself — But Lisa Isn’t Having It</b></p><p>Stassi appeared to explain why she decided to return back to the show after leaving for 12 episodes. She said for what felt like the millionth time that she is so sorry to everyone in the group she has hurt, but she claimed she needed to “have a rock-bottom moment” to get better. However, some of the members of the group, especially Jax and Tom Sandoval, believed that Stassi had an ulterior motive for returning.</p><p>Jax said she reignited her friendship with Kristen because Kristen is “the weakest link,” and it was the easiest way for Stassi to weasel her way back on camera. Sandoval was mad about the way Stassi treated Katie, but Stassi said she just thinks Sandoval is out to get her.</p><p>Lisa could not handle listening to Stassi apologize anymore. The Sur boss said Stassi thinks that just because she apologizes, everyone should go back to liking her.</p><p>“I think that if there wasn’t this show, none of you would have ever heard from Stassi Schroeder again,” Lisa said. She thinks Stassi is only in it for the fame, and said she is angry for the way Stassi spoke about her on camera, even after all that Lisa has done to help her.</p><p>Stassi felt very differently about the situation and said, “I feel that you hold things over my head, like I owe the rest of my life to you all of the time, and I feel like that’s not fair.”</p><p>The former Sur server said that even though she believes she owes Lisa her respect, that doesn’t mean she is “wholeheartedly just in love with [Lisa.]” That didn’t bother Lisa, though, who was quick to respond and said, “I don’t want you to be — trust me because the feeling’s not mutual.”</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: Do you side with Lisa or Stassi?</p><p><i>Vanderpump Rules</i> airs on Bravo on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBuvsSupaKnnmK%2Fpq%2FAqWSloaOWerSt2KxkrKyRqMCqedSsnJ1lmJq%2FbsORaWdubWNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-peek-inside-ryan-seacrests-51-million-beverly-hills-home.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Peek Inside Ryan Seacrests $51 Million Beverly Hills home</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-littons-obituary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tragic moment!
