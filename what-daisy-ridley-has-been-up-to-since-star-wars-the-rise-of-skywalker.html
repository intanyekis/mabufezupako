The movie concludes the third Star Wars trilogy, and it also wraps up Ridley’s work in the sci-fi franchise for now. Since then, the actress has been involved in several projects that don’t require intergalactic travel.</p><h2 id=for-daisy-ridley-life-after-star-wars-was-hard>For Daisy Ridley, Life After Star Wars Was Hard</h2><p>Star Wars may be a massively successful film franchise but that essentially has consequences for some of its actors. Specifically, they find it hard to get employed again. Oscar-winner Natalie Portman, who once portrayed Padmé Amidala, had <a href=#>mentioned something similar after working on Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</a>. Several years later, it seems Ridley experienced&nbsp;the same fate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Weirdly, at the beginning of the year nothing was coming through,” Ridley revealed while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking with Entertainment Weekly</a> last year. “I was like, 'Aww! No one wants to employ me.” To make matters worse, Ridley actively went out for roles but ultimately, nothing panned out. “There were actually loads of things that I auditioned for at the beginning of the year and didn’t get any of them.” Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ridley also told Variety</a>, “I just want to be in good things and work with great people.” Fortunately, it wasn’t long before she got her wish.</p><h2 id=she-landed-a-role-in-a-film-with-tom-holland>She Landed A Role In A Film With Tom Holland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/A-scene-from-Chaos-Walking-via-The-New-York-TImes.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first, work was trickling in slowly. For starters, she got a call about voicing the PC and Xbox game Twelve Minutes where a man is forced to relive the past 12 minutes of his life over and over again after a stranger forces himself into his apartment to attack his wife. Aside from this, Ridley also booked voice work for the video game The Dawn of Art and the short Baba Yaga. And then it happened, Ridley booked another film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Daisy Ridley Trends On Twitter As Fans Wish Her A Happy 29th Birthday</a></span></p><p>Directed by Doug Liman (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Edge of Tomorrow), Chaos Walking marks Ridley’s first feature film since her last Star Wars&nbsp;movie. Aside from Ridley, Chaos Walking also boasts of an ensemble that includes Tom Holland, Mads Mikkelsen, David Oyelowo, Demián Bichir, and Nick Jonas. In the movie, Ridley plays Viola, a mysterious young woman who makes a crash landing in a planet where all women have already died and men are suffering from “the Noise.” Not to mention, women are capable of hearing the men’s thoughts but not the other way around. The one who discovers Viola is Holland’s Todd and from then on, the two had to rely on each other for survival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the film’s production, Ridley collaborated extensively with everyone working behind the camera. For instance, she decided to have some of her lines removed for her character to differentiate her more from Holland’s character. “Our script supervisor was like, 'Actors don't do this.’ But a big thing I wanted to do was have that real contrast with Todd, particularly, where everything's so loud and so out there,” Ridley explained while speaking with Entertainment Weekly. “Viola is really quiet. Often when you are launched into [something], you think it's going to be the thing, and then it isn't that thing, and I definitely clam up. So, I was happy that they let me lean into that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Star Wars' Actor Has A Higher Net Worth: Daisy Ridley Or John Boyega?</a></span></p><p>After the film’s initial cut was done, rumors surfaced that it was “unreleasable.” Eventually, reshoots had to be done. Even during this time, Ridley continued to give her input both on and off-screen. She especially had a keen observation about the Noise. “I'd seen an early cut of the film, and the Noise wasn't as present as it is now,” the actress explained. “I was able to be part of a conversation of basically saying, 'The Noise is such a vital part of this film. It really needs to be present, but it can't overshadow everything else that's going on.'” Despite the reshoots and all of the film’s star power, however, Chaos Walking still flopped.</p><h2 id=daisy-also-has-a-lineup-of-other-films-in-the-works>Daisy Also Has A Lineup Of Other Films In The Works</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, Chaos Walking’s lukewarm reception didn’t dampen Ridley’s job prospects. At the moment, her name is attached to three other upcoming movies. There’s the drama thriller The Marsh King’s Daughter and the history drama Women in the Castle, which would also reportedly star Kristin Scott Thomas. Aside from these, Ridley has also reportedly signed up to voice on the animated film The Inventor, along with Marion Cotillard and Stephen Fry.</p><p>Today, even amidst the pandemic, Ridley continues to be busy with work and that’s something she’s grateful for. “I think it's been an amazing time for everybody to realize how important every single job that every single person in this world has…”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Nick Jonas On Acting Opposite Daisy Ridley, Tom Holland In Dystopian Drama 'Chaos Walking'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGitdKyZKuhlKGyunnHmqpmmpWau27Bz2arqGWjnruksYysq5qqXayus7%2BMrZ%2BeZaKewKZ5zp9krKOprK6tt8SrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boyz-ii-men-shawn-stockman-rnb-lost-identity-1234673464.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boyz II Men's Shawn Stockman Claims RnB Has Lost Identity Following Verzus Battle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lionel-messi-wiki-height-weight-age-girlfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lionel Messi Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
