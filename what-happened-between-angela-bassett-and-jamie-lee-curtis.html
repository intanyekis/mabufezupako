Back in 1994, everyone thought <a href=# rel=nofollow>she was "robbed" when she didn't win an Oscar</a> for Best Actress for playing Tina Turner in What's Love Got to Do with It. But in an interview ahead of the ceremony this year, she said that she's made peace with it.</p><p>"Of course, in the moment you're hoping and praying and wishing [you'll win]," she admitted to Gayle King on CBS Mornings. "But I never - I don't walk away thinking 'I've been robbed.' That's too negative of an emotion to carry with me for the rest of my life.

She recalled "working out, getting up at 5 a.m." and eating "standing up, just so frazzled on black coffee, plain chicken breasts, white potatoes, and green beans."</p><p>"That's all that I ate during that time. They would still say, 'Tina has a high butt. You have a low butt,'" she continued, noting that it only made her stronger back then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I just remember thinking, You might lose a battle, but we're trying to win a war.
