Skversky’s bio has been taken from the WPVI website, according to our low-level research.</p><p>For that kind of thing, TV stations don’t send out press releases, and the star in question usually just says something on Twitter, but Jeff hasn’t said anything. The radio-quiet is a little strange.</p><p>Jeff interned at WPVI-TV, which was branded on-air as 6 ABC, before being hired as a full-time anchor. It is a television station owned and operated by ABC and licensed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the United States.</p><p>The Walt Disney Company’s ABC Owned Television Stations subsidiary owns the station.
