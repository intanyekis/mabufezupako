While Cavallari and Colletti’s <a href=#>teenage love affair</a> fizzled out after the <a href=#>One Tree Hill</a> alum graduated from school — he is one year older than <a href=#>the Hills</a> star — the two have remained close.</p><p>“We’re friends. I speak to them from time to time,” the Everyone Is Doing Great producer <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in July 2018 of his dynamic with both Cavallari and Conrad post-high school. “I’ll go down. Conrad will throw a killer 4th of July party in Laguna, and so I’m usually down there for that. And then, yeah, <a href=#>I’ll speak with Cavallari from time to time</a>. We always just check in and say hello.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Very Cavallari alum</a>, who was married to <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> for seven years before announcing <a href=#>their split in April 2020</a>, reflected on her “great” relationship with Colletti while writing her 2016 book, <a href=#>Balancing in Heels: My Journey to Health, Happiness, and Making It All Work</a>.</p><p>Cavallari claimed that her <a href=#>mean girl personality on screen</a> was a result of her fighting to keep her relationship with Colletti afloat despite producers pressuring him to hang out with Conrad.</p><p>“I did the only thing I knew how to do: put up a wall. That made it look like I didn’t care about anyone but myself. But Stephen was the most important thing in my life, and there was nothing I cared about more,” the Uncommon James founder, who shares <a href=#>Camden, Jaxon and Saylor</a> with the former NFL player, wrote at the time. “I hated fighting with him on camera because it felt like I was airing all our dirty laundry … To some I seemed confident and beyond my high school years; to others, I seemed like a mean girl. Either way, I was shocked and sad that I was being portrayed as anything but myself: <a href=#>a sarcastic, goofy girl who just wanted to have fun</a>.”</p><p>In the years since high school, fans have continued to <a href=#>hold a torch for Cavallari and Colletti</a> — as have some of their childhood friends.</p><p>“I love that so much. It was so cute to see them together,” <a href=#><strong>Alex Hooser</strong></a> said during a September 2020 appearance on “The Gay & The Girl” podcast, <a href=#>referencing the exes’ reunion photo that they took earlier that summer</a>. “I don’t know [if they’ll get together]. I hope so. I feel like if those two came together and went to MTV and were like, ‘OK, we’re ready to do this,’ they’d be like, ‘OK, it’s on.’”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mox cofounder was completely on board</a> with the idea of her pals rekindling their romance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I would love that. That is full circle,” Hooser continued. “I’m the one originally, like, when they first, I somewhat introduced Stephen to Kristin because I was friends with Stephen and I, like, gave him or her — I gave one of them each other’s number.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what Cavallari and Colletti have said about their friendship over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKmt02aiq6GjqbavecKarZqknJa%2FqnnSrZypoJWjeqS7y6WcrayZYsCitcNmp6irpGK5orPUp5hmmpWWsKl7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./camilla-poindexter-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Camilla Poindexter Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./spoonkid-face-reveal-how-old-is-spoonkid-312622.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spoonkid Face Reveal, How Old Is Spoonkid?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
