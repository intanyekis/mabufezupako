Police confirmed to <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>that Slim, 33, was gunned down Wednesday (Nov. 8) in Los Angeles. The popular hip-hop podcast <strong>No Jumper </strong>was the first to break the news of Slim’s passing, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeting</a>, “Rapper Slim400 has reportedly been killed, R.I.P.,” along with a picture of the slain man.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Shortly after the word of Slim’s passing hit the internet, fan-shot videos of the taped-off crime scene began circulating. Unfortunately, these videos don’t shed any more light on the situation. As of Thursday morning, the details of Slim’s shooting are nil, but <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>will update this post when more information is made available. In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about Slim 400.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/slim-400-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed.jpg><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>1. Slim 400 Was A Rapper.</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Slim was born Vincent Cohran to military parents on June 22, 1988, in Frankfurt, Germany, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>. Slim and his parents moved back to the states when he was a young child, roughly 11 months old. Slim grew up in Compton, California, and began rapping at the young age of 12. It wouldn’t be long after his start that his talents would catch the eye of his fellow hip-hop stars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“That’s all I know, Bompton,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Herb</a> magazine, changing the name of his town to “conform with the Bloods’ preferred rendering of the word,” per the publication. He also named himself 400 after his neighborhood block.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>2. He’s Best Known For His Collaboration With YG.</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Slim was close with rapper <strong>YG</strong>. It was Pu$haz Ink, the now-defunct music label popularized by YG (b. <strong>Keenon Jackson</strong>) and <strong>DJ Mustard</strong>, that discovered Slim and signed him in 2008. Slim worked with YG on the single “Bruisin.” He also appeared in YG’s 2014 short film, Blame It On The Streets. In 2017, Slim teamed with <strong>Snoop Dogg </strong>and <strong>Compton AV </strong>for “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Throw It Up</a>.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In his short time on this earth, Slim released a handful of mixtapes – High Off Treez, Keeping It 400, Foe Block, Foe Block 2, Foe Reala, and Shake It Black – and a few singles and EPs. He was a well-respected member of the West Coast scene and always seemed poise for a mainstream breakthrough.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>3. He Had A Businessman’s Mind.</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>In 2018, Slim lent his persona with BudTrader.com, a startup that bills itself as the “medical marijuana marketplace,” per Herb magazine. “Weed is going to sell, bro, period,” he said about the partnership. “I took a couple of shares under my name,” he added. Slim said that he used to sell on the streets during cannabis’s prohibition in California (the state legalized recreational use in 2016, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Time</a>) and thought it would be better to get involved in the legal sale of pot.</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>4. Slim 400 Was Shot Before.</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-11>Slim was shot nine times in a 2019 drive-by in his hometown, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hot New Hip Hop</a>. Slim was visiting his family in Compton when the shooting happened, and one of his kin had to risk their own life to drag him indoors while the assailants kept firing at the home. A month after the shooting, he sat down with a Los Angeles radio station to share his experience.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I just feel like when you meant to be here, and God have a plan for you, it ain’t no stoppin’ it,” he said. “I hit the ground thinking it was over. My family came out, kept me alive, talking to me, dragging me in the house while they still shooting…My family, love her to death for just saving me. I just feel like I’m blessed just to be here ’cause I could have just died then and there.”</p><h3><span><span><b><i><strong>5. He Was Reportedly A Father.</strong></i></b></span></span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-13>Slim was a bit reserved when it came to parts of his private life. He reportedly had a daughter named <strong>Parris</strong>, who was born in 2009.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LArbXMZmtpaF1pgnqEmG5uaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eliud-kipchoge-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eliud Kipchoge Net Worth: The Wealth Of Olympian Eliud Kipchoge May Surprise You.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tristan-thompson-allegedly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tristan Thompson allegedly owes ex Jordan Craig child support</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
