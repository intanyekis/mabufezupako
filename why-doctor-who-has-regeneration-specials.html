The genre made it big thanks to comics, books, films, radio programs, and early television shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plenty of media was being pumped out to the masses, like the well-known Attack of the 50 FT Woman, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and The Twilight Zone. One of the longest-running sci-fi programs is the cultural phenomenon known as Doctor Who.</p><p>Doctor Who took the world by storm when it originally premiered in the early 1960s on BBC (British Broadcasting Channel). The show follows a time-traveling humanoid alien, simply referred to as The Doctor, <a href=#>and their companions</a> as they journey through time and space in their police call box masked spaceship known as the TARDIS.</p><p>The Doctor and their companions always find a way to save the day right on time while battling threats to the world. Doctor Who does a wonderful job of sending off the titular character after a few seasons in a way that is special and unique compared to other science fiction programs that keep its viewers coming back for more of the character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=each-doctor-typically-lasts-several-seasons>Each Doctor (Typically) Lasts Several Seasons</h2><p>So far, there are fifteen Doctors, including the controversial War Doctor. Since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show has been running since the 1960s</a>, with a brief break from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, most of the actors had the opportunity to play The Doctor for several seasons before they were sent off.</p><p>The First Doctor was portrayed by British actor William Hartnell for the first three years of the series. His successor, Patrick Troughton, played the titular character for the following three years. Doctor three took over for the following four years courtesy of Jon Pertwee.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Billie Piper Returned To The 'Doctor Who' Universe After So Long?">Why Billie Piper Returned To The 'Doctor Who' Universe After So Long?</a></span></p><p>One of the most popular Doctors was the beloved Fourth Doctor, played by the lively Tom Baker. References to this Doctor are made often throughout the life of the show. He played The Doctor for the longest time, staying on the series for seven years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Doctors only stayed on board for two seasons each thanks to Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy. A brief pause in the show would happen until the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann, made his appearance for a television movie.</p><p>According to the show's lore, it is after the Eighth Doctor that the War Doctor allegedly comes to fruition, although fans of the series would not come to know his face until John Hurt played him many years later during The Day of the Doctor special.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, BBC decided to revive the series for a new generation and picked Christopher Eccleston as the series Ninth Doctor. <a href=#>Eccleston only portrayed The Doctor for one season</a>, stating that he left because his "relationship with the show runner and producers broke down" and he did not like the way certain things were being run during this time on set.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Actors Were Rumored To Star In 'Doctor Who' – But It Never Happened">These Actors Were Rumored To Star In 'Doctor Who' – But It Never Happened</a></span></p><p>The show once again took off, and David Tennant became the incredibly beloved Tenth Doctor for five years before the whimsical Matt Smith took over as the Eleventh iteration of the character. Three years later, Peter Capaldi took over as the Twelfth Doctor.</p><p>Jodie Whittaker got her shot to play the very first female incarnation of The Doctor for four years. <a href=#>Ncuti Gatwa is currently set up to play the next Doctor in the series</a>, but Jodie Whittaker's finale ends with the never done before plot twist of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Tennant returning to play the character</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-doctor-never-dies-but-simply-regenerates>The Doctor Never Dies, But Simply Regenerates</h2><p>Those who are new to the series may be wondering how it works, having different actors playing what appears to be a different character under the same name. The Doctor has always been the same person.</p><p>That is to say, The Doctor has and will always be The Doctor, regardless of who plays them.</p><p>This is done incredibly by the show thanks to the regeneration specials. Rather than kill off the character, they simply regenerate to a new form better suited for their current needs.</p><p>Each time The Doctor comes back, they look different, talk different, act different, and have a new interior to their TARDIS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show does an amazing job of making the regeneration of the character an emotional yet exciting experience for the viewer. While it's sad to watch a character go away, viewers are always ready and willing to see who will be the new Doctor and how this one will be different from the last.</p><p>And each version of The Doctor always has a special line they say just before they get their new form. One of the most emotionally hard-hitting regenerations was that of David Tennant, Doctor Ten, turning into Matt Smith's Doctor Eleven.</p><p>A teary-eyed Doctor Ten simply looks off as he starts glowing and says "I don't want to go" before he has no choice but to change in a beam of light and power.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="'Doctor Who' Nearly Had A Crossover Episode With 'Harry Potter' ">'Doctor Who' Nearly Had A Crossover Episode With 'Harry Potter'</a></span></p><p>Matt Smiths was perhaps one of the most popular ones as well when he tells his companion "I will always remember when The Doctor was me," takes off his ever-present bow-tie, and throws his head back before coming back as the Twelfth Doctor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=each-doctor-has-an-interesting-reaction-to-their-new-form>Each Doctor Has An Interesting Reaction To Their New Form</h2><p>It seems The Doctor needs to get accustomed to their new body with each regeneration. Fans of the show know that the change typically happens with The Doctor making some kind of goodbye speech before seeming to burst into a bright yellow light beam.</p><p>Once the light subsides, viewers are treated to what The Doctor will look like going forward. When Peter Capaldi took over, he stared wide-eyed at his companion before gripping his sides and screaming "Kidneys! I've got new kidneys!", a decidedly comedic reaction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Doctor Thirteen regenerates back to David Tennant</a>, essentially Doctor Ten once again, he says "I know these teeth" before shoving his fingers in his mouth for confirmation. He then examines his hands and clothing, touches his face, apparently, in shock that he has taken on this form.</p><p>The specials give fans 90 minutes of pure fantasy, and each Doctors reaction to their changing body is decidedly special and does a fantastic job of introducing the newest Doctors personality to the fan base in an easily digestible way through thoroughly entertaining means.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbykwM6rZLCgn2K1or%2BMq5ygnZ6av6LAyKilZqugmrCqrcusZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jushay-rockett.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jushay Rockett</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-it-like-to-work-with-katy-perry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What Other Artists Have Said About Working With Katy Perry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anton-yelchins-most-memorable-film-roles-w210616.html>Anton Yelchins Most Memorable Film Roles</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./pauline-chalamet-breast-reduction-timothee-chalamet-sister-weight-loss-before-and-after-530307-html.html>Pauline Chalamet Breast Reduction: Timothee Chalamet Sister Weight Loss Before And After</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peso-plumas-real-name-and-other-facts-you-didnt-know-about-him.html>Peso Plumas Real Name and Other Facts You Didnt Know About Him</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-offices-angela-kinsey-reveals-which-line-she-had-cut-from-the-show.html>The Offices Angela Kinsey Reveals Which Line She Had Cut From the Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./this-is-how-rebel-wilson-started-and-grew-her-22-million-empire.html>This Is How Rebel Wilson Started And Grew Her $22 Million Empire</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVib.
